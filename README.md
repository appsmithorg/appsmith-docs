# Introduction

Appsmith is a JavaScript-based visual development platform to build and launch internal tools quickly. Use pre-built UI widgets, connect them to your APIs and databases to build dynamic apps and complex workflows.

## How does Appsmith work?

You need to understand five principles to build apps. 

* Create your page by using UI components
* Connect Appsmith to your data-sources like REST APIs, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, and other databases.
* Write your queries and business logic in the SQL or JS editor 
* Bind UI to your query responses or business logic 
* Deploy your app with a click and invite users

Using these steps you can create simple CRUD apps to complicated multi-step workflows. Appsmith makes it really easy to build UI that talks to any data-source. You can customize the app by writing JS everywhere including inside your DB queries.
