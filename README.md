# Introduction

Appsmith is a low code, open-source framework to build internal applications.

With our JavaScript-based visual development platform, build CRUD apps, Dashboards, Admin Panels, and many more 10x faster.   
You can use our pre-built UI widgets, connect them to your APIs and databases to build dynamic apps and complex workflows. And the best part? Deploy these apps on the technology you prefer! \(self-host for free!\). 

## How does Appsmith work?

Here are five simple steps to create an app in Appsmith:

* **Connect Any Datasource**: You can integrate any database with Appsmith, including REST APIs, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Google Sheets, and others;
* **Build UI**: With pre-built widgets, you can create UI in seconds;
* **Create and Execute Queries**: Write queries and business logic in the SQL or JS Editor and then bind responses;
* **Customize with Ease**: Write JS everywhere, even inside your DB queries, to customize your app;
* **Collaborate and Deploy**: Invite your colleagues and friends to work with you and deploy your app with just a click.

With these simple steps, you can create simple CRUD apps to complicated multi-step workflows. Appsmith makes it easy to build a UI that talks to any data source.
