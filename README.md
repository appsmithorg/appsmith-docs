## Creating an account

New to Appsmith? You can quickly create an account on our cloud environment which comes with mock data for you to play around with. Read about our [data security.](faq.md#what-type-of-data-security-does-appsmith-provide) If you want to connect your own data and are uncomfortable with our cloud version, you can deploy appsmith on your local machine or private server instance.
