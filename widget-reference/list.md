# List

{% hint style="info" %}
List widget is in beta right now. It can only render widgets for display purposes in the template as of now. This is a platform limitation that will be solved in future. You won't be able to use any widget that has any default value \( Input, Switch, Checkbox, Select etc \)   
{% endhint %}

## Current Item

List widget is used to repeat a template based on the large data \(collection on objects\). The template is basically a container widget that repeats itself. In each widget in the template, you might need access to the current item, That's where `currentItem` property comes in handy. It gives access to the current item in the loop. For e.g - If you want to show an image widget in the list, you can use:

```text
{{ currentItem.avatar}}

// assuming avatar is a property in the array of objects in the items
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: currentItem is only available in the autocomplete of controls, in the property pane of list widget template's children.   
{% endhint %}
