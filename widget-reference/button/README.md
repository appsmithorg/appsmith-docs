### Widget Properties

These properties allow you to edit the button widget. All these properties are present in the property pane of the widget. The following table lists all the widget properties.

| Property                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Tooltip**              | It sets a tooltip for the widget. You can add hints or extra information about the required input from the user.                                                                                                 |
| **Google Recaptcha Key** | Adds a [Google ReCAPTCHA v3](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/) check to the button. The token will be accessible from the API pane with the `recaptchaToken` key (see [Google reCAPTCHA](google-recaptcha.md)). |
| **Visible**              | Controls widget's visibility on the page. When turned off, the widget will not be visible when the app is published but shows a translucent state in edit mode                                                   |
| **Disabled**             | It makes the button un-clickable or unusable. The widget will remain visible to the user but user input will not be allowed.                                                                                     |
| **Animate loading**      | Controls widgetâ€™s loading animation on the page. When turned off, the widget will load without any skeletal animation. This can be controlled with JS until all the widgets are rendered.                        |

Let's understand the widget properties in detail.

#### Label

It lets the user set the text inside the button, describing the function it performs. For example, if a button performs an action that updates the data, you can enter the label as "Update."

#### Visible

`Visible` controls the widget's visibility on the app's page. The widget will not be visible on the published app if you turn off this property. You can also write a JS code to link Visible's functionality to a user action. Click on `JS` next to the `Visible` to write JavaScript code.

For example, let's drag a checkbox widget `checkbox1` onto the canvas and bind it to the `Visible` property. To enable the `Visible` when the user checks the checkbox, add the following JavaScript code:

```
{{Checkbox1.isChecked}}
```

When you tick the checkbox, it will enable the Visible property, and the button will be visible in the app.

#### Disabled

When it is enabled, It makes the button unclickable and removes the focus from the button widget. The widget will be visible (if Visible is enabled) in a disabled state, but user click will not be allowed. You can also write a JS code to link Disabled's functionality to a user action. Click on `JS` next to the `Disabled` to write JavaScript code.

For example, let's drag a checkbox widget `checkbox1` onto the canvas and bind it to the `Disabled` property. To enable the `Disabled` when the user checks the checkbox, add the following JavaScript code:

```
{{Checkbox1.isChecked}}
```

When you tick the checkbox, it will enable the Disabled property and prevent a user input on the button.
