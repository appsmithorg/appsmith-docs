## Displaying Data

A Radio Button's **options** can be populated from a data source like an API / Query by connecting the data to the options field. Begin by converting the options to a JS field by clicking the JS icon. The options field requires an array of \(label, value\) so you may need to transform your data. The transformation can be performed using javascript so if the data is an array, we can transform it using the [Array.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/map) function.

```javascript
// Query1.data is assumed to be an array here
{{ Query1.data.map((row) => { 
      return { label: row.name, value: row.id } 
   }) 
}}
```
