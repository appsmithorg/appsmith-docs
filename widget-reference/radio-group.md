Below are the properties that you can use:

#### **Text**

It allows you to set the display name for the Radio Group. For example, if you want the user to select a Gender Type, you can enter the text as "Gender."

{% hint style="info" %}
You can leave the text empty if you don't want any display name for your Radio Group widget.
{% endhint %}

#### **Position**

It allows you to specify the placement of the label. You can select one of the available options:

* Top - It allows you to align the text at the top of the Radio Group.
* Left - It aligns the text to the left of the Radio Group. When you select **Left** alignment, you get additional settings that you can use to control the alignment and define the text's width.
  * Alignment - With the help of alignment, you can define the placement of the text in accordance with the position of the Radio Group. You can choose:
    * Left - It aligns the text to the widget's left boundary that is away from the Radio Group.
    * Right - It aligns the text closer to the Radio Group.
  * Width - With the help of width, you can define the **number of columns** in the **grid** that surrounds the widget. You can specify how close or far the text can be placed to the Radio Group.
* Auto - It automatically adjusts the position of the text based on the Radio Group's height.
