## Upload File

You can upload files by creating a post API and referring to the base64 or binary version of the file in the post body.

```text
{{ Filepicker1.files[0].base64 }}

{{ Filepicker1.files[0].raw }}
```

See our guides on

* [Uploading a File to S3](../how-to-guides/how-to-upload-to-s3.md)
