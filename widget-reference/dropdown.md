## Displaying Data

A Dropdown's **options** can be populated from a data source like an API / Query by transforming the API / Query data to an array of \(label, value\). The transformation can be performed using javascript so if the data is an array, we can transform it using the [**Array.map**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/map) function.

```javascript
// Query1.data is assumed to be an array here
{{ Query1.data.map((row) => { 
      return { label: row.name, value: row.id } 
   }) 
}}
```

## Filtering Data

A Dropdown can be used to filter a dataset based on the user's input. The selected option value can be passed to an API using**`{{ dropdownName.selectedOptionValue }}`** for Single Select Dropdowns and **`{{ dropdownName.selectedOptionValueArr }}`** for Multi-Select Dropdowns.

## **Form Submission**

Dropdown widgets can be used to capture from a fixed set of options inside a form such as gender, role, status.

{% hint style="success" %}
Some forms need to be pre-filled data from a table or API. We can bind the data to the default text property to enable this
{% endhint %}

```text
{{ Table1.selectedRow.gender }}
/**
* Binding this to the default option will update the selected option 
* of the dropdown with the gender of the selected row in Table1
*/
```
