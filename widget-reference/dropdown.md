## Filtering Data

A Dropdown can be used to filter a dataset based on users input. The selected option value can be passed to an API using**`{{ dropdownName.selectedOptionValue }}`** for single select Dropdowns and **`{{ dropdownName.selectedOptionValueArr }}`** for multi select Dropdowns.

## **Form Submission**

Dropdown widgets can be used to capture from a fixed set of options inside a form such as gender, role, status. 

{% hint style="success" %}
Some forms need to be pre-filled data from a table or API. We can bind the data to the default text property to enable this
{% endhint %}

```text
{{ Table1.selectedRow.gender }}
/**
* Binding this to the default option will update the selected option 
* of the dropdown with the gender of the selected row in Table1
*/
```
