## Displaying Data

A Dropdown's **options** can be populated from a data source like an API / Query by transforming the incoming data to an array of \(label, value\). The transformation can be performed using javascript. So if the data is an array, we can transform it using the [**Array.map**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/map) function.

```javascript
// Query1.data is assumed to be an array here
{{ Query1.data.map((row) => { 
      return { label: row.name, value: row.id } 
   }) 
}}
```

## Filtering Data

A Dropdown can be used to filter a dataset based on the user's input. The selected value can be passed to an API using\*\*`{{ dropdownName.selectedOptionValue }}` .

## **Form Submission**

Dropdown widgets can be used to capture from a fixed set of options inside a form such as gender, role, status.

{% hint style="success" %}
Some forms need to be pre-filled data from a table or API. We can bind the data to the default text property to enable this
{% endhint %}

```text
{{ Table1.selectedRow.gender }}
/**
* Binding this to the default option will update the selected option 
* of the dropdown with the gender of the selected row in Table1
*/
```
