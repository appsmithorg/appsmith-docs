  The table is used to display rows of data. You can display data from an API in
  a table, trigger an action when a user selects a row, and even work with large
  paginated data sets

## Selected Row

Tables are useful to view large lists of data. To drill down into the data of a single row, the selected row property of a table can be used. Simply create UI that represents a row of a table and bind each widget to the selected row of the table. This code snippet illustrates binding an image column of the selected row to an Image widget.

```text
{{ Table1.selectedRow.imageUrl }}
```
