## Form Widgets

Form widgets are a class of widgets that are typically used to capture user information. These widgets may be used outside a form such as form filtering data but their primary use is to capture user input. These are the form widgets Appsmith supports

* \*\*\*\*[**Input**](input.md) ****
* \*\*\*\*[**Dropdown**](dropdown.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Datepicker**](datepicker.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Filepicker**](filepicker.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**RadioGroup**](radio.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Checkbox**](checkbox.md)\*\*\*\*

## Sending Form data to an API

User inputs in a form can be sent to an API by binding the individual widgets inside a form to the API body or query params.

```text
{
  "name" : "{{ inputText.text }}"
}
```
