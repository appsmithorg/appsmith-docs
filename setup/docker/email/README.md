## Enabling Email

1. To enable email, open the docker.env file of your Appsmith installation and uncomment the following block

```text
# ***** Email **********
APPSMITH_MAIL_ENABLED=false
# APPSMITH_MAIL_FROM=YOUR_VERIFIED_EMAIL_ID
# APPSMITH_REPLY_TO=YOUR_VERIFIED_EMAIL_ID
# APPSMITH_MAIL_HOST=
# APPSMITH_MAIL_PORT=
# ***** Set to true if providing a TLS port ******
# APPSMITH_MAIL_SMTP_TLS_ENABLED=
# APPSMITH_MAIL_USERNAME=
# APPSMITH_MAIL_PASSWORD=
# APPSMITH_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH=true
