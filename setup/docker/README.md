# Docker

Appsmith can be deployed locally or on your private instance using Docker.Just ensure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system and you're ready to go!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Machines like M1 laptops that require a docker ARM image are not currently supported
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) \(version 20.10.7 or later\)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) \(version 1.29.2 or later\)

## Quick Start \(without docker-compose\)

To quickly get a taste of this, run the following command on your machine:

```bash
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -p 9001:9001 appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

This will download the image and start Appsmith. Once the download is complete, the server should be up in under a minute. You can follow the logs with the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f appsmith
```

## Long Start \(with docker-compose\)

The Appsmith Docker image is built with all the components required for it to run, within a single Docker container. All these multiple processes are managed by a Supervisord instance, which is a lightweight process manager.

### Docker compose configuration

Create a folder called `appsmith`, where you would like your Appsmith installation, and data to live in. Download the below `docker-compose.yml` file into the folder

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/docker-compose.yml" caption="docker-compose.yml" %}

{% code title="docker-compose.yml" %}
```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
    container_name: appsmith
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "9001:9001"
    volumes:
      - ./stacks:/appsmith-stacks
    labels:
      com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable: "true"

  auto_update:
    image: containrrr/watchtower:latest-dev
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    # Update check interval in seconds.
    command: --interval 300 --label-enable --cleanup
```
{% endcode %}

This configuration runs an Appsmith instance, and a Watchtower instance to keep Appsmith automatically up-to-date.

Now, `cd` to the folder where this file was saved to, and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will download the Docker images, if not already locally available, and start the services. You can see the status with `docker-compose ps`, and view the logs with `docker-compose logs -f appsmith`.

Congratulations! Your Appsmith server should be up and running now. You can access it at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

## Custom domain and HTTPS

If you have a custom domain, already pointing to the server where you are running Appsmith, it's super easy to get HTTPS. Just tell Appsmith about the custom domain and you're on.

In the folder where you created `docker-compose.yml` file, look for `stacks/configuration/docker.env` file. Open it in an editor like nano or vim, and change the value of the variable `APPSMITH_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` to the custom domain you are using.

For example, if you are using `appsmith.mydomain.com` as your custom domain for Appsmith, then set this variable like this:

```bash
APPSMITH_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=appsmith.mydomain.com
```

Save this file and restart the appsmith container:

```bash
docker-compose restart appsmith
```

Now your Appsmith should be available at https://appsmith.mydomain.com, with automatic certificate provisioning and renewals.

## Troubleshooting

## Enabling Services for Self Hosting

Appsmith ships with third-party services that improve the app building experience. All third-party services are entirely optional.

{% hint style="success" %}
All third party services are enabled by default in our [cloud-hosted](https://app.appsmith.com) version.
{% endhint %}

Our self-hosted version allows you to configure your own keys to enable third party services such as Google OAuth. To enable a service, simply open the folder of your Appsmith installation and edit the `docker.env` file.

Each service requires a specific key or configuration to be enabled. Configure the service of your choice using the following guides

* [Email](email/)
* [Google OAuth](google-login.md)
* [GitHub OAuth](github-login.md)
* [Google Maps](google-maps.md)
* [Disable Signups](disable-user-signup.md)
* [Custom Domain](custom-domain.md)

You may need root access to modify the `docker.env` file.

After making any changes, remember to restart editor and backend for the changes to take affect.

```bash
sudo docker-compose exec supervisorctl restart editor backend
```
