# Querying Firestore

The Firestore plugin can connect to Firestore an execute the set of officially supported ways of querying. This document describes connecting Appsmith to a Firestore instance and applying the various operations on a Firestore instance.

## Configuring a Firestore Datasource

The Firestore plugin requires three pieces of information to connect to Firestore. Here's the form in Appsmith when creating a new Firestore datasource:

These three details are available from the Firebase Console. Let's fetch them in turn.

For Project ID,

1. Go to "Project Settings" in your Firebase console and ensure you're in the "General" tab.
1. Here, you'll find a "Project ID" entry with a value.
1. Copy this value into the "Project ID" field in the datasource configuration.

For the Database URL,

1. Now open in the "Service Accounts" tab in the same page.
1. Here, you should see a NodeJS code snippet with a `databaseURL` object field.
1. Copy the URL in this value (**without the https:// part**) and paste it in the "Database URL" field of the datasource configuration.

For the Service Account Credentials,

1. Just below this code snippet, there is a "Generate new private key" button.
1. Clicking this button will generate a new private key with access to this Firestore instance.
1. This key will be in the form of a JSON file which will be downloaded when you click this button.
1. Copy the **contents** of this file and paste it into the "Service Account Credentials" field.

After filling up the three fields as described above, click on the "Test" button to verify our configuration and then click on "Save".

## Fetching Data

There's two methods for fetching data from Firestore. One for fetching a single document by path and another for fetching multiple documents from a collection by path.

### Fetching Single Document

Select the method "Get Single Document" in the Method dropdown and set the path to the full path of the document you want to load. The path should be provided **without** any leading or trailing `/` characters.

For example, setting the path to `users/sherlock@gmail.com` will get the document with ID `sherlock@gmail.com` inside the collection `users`.

### Fetching Multiple Documents

Select the method "Get Documents in Collection" in the Method dropdown and set the path to the collection from which we want to fetch the documents. The path should be provided **without** any leading or trailing `/` characters.

![Click to expand](../../.gitbook/assets/firestore-get-documents-in-collection.png)

**Order By**: Set this to a field name by which the documents will be sorted. For example, if in the given collection, you have document like `{"name": "Sherlock", "role": "Detective"}` and `{"name": "Watson", "role": "Doctor"}`, then we can put `name` in the Order By input so that the documents are ordered by the `name` field in each document.

**Limit Documents**: This should be a number, which will be the maximum number of documents fetched. Setting this to a *very* high number may impact performance of your application, but the impact and how high will depend on the size of the documents being fetched.

**Where Condition**: This is a set of three fields that allow you to apply a filter on the documents being fetched. The first field, **Field Path** is path of a nested field, on which to apply the filtering. Example values are `name` or something like `name.first` if the documents look like `{"name": {"first": "Sherlock", "last": "Holmes"}}`, etc. The second field is the operator and third is the value to apply the filter with.

For the array operators like `in`, the value can be set to a valid JSON-serialized array. For example, the field path can be `name`, operator can be `in` and the value can be `["Sherlock", "Mycroft"]`. This will filter all documents with a `name` field set to either `"Sherlock"` or `"Mycroft"`.

### Adding New Document(s)

There's three methods that can be used to add documents to a collection, depending on the exact behaviour needed.

1. "**Set Document**" method: This method will *set* the given document at the given *document path*. If a document already exists at the given path, it will be completely **removed**, before setting the given document. If a document doesn't already exist at this path, the path will be created and this document will be set.
1. "**Create Document**" method: This method will *set* the given document at the given *document path*. If a document already exists at the given path, this method will **fail** and the given document is **not saved**. If a document doesn't already exist at this path, the path will be created and this document will be set.
1. "**Add Document to Collection**" method: This method will *add* the given document with an auto-generated document-id, into the given *collection path*. Note that in this method, the given path must point to a collection. If the collection doesn't exist at the given path, it will be created.

All three method above take a path and a body as inputs. The path is interpreted as described above and the body is expected to contain a valid JSON-serialized object which will make up the document to be used in the operation (as described above).

### Updating Document

The "Update Document" method can be used to surgically update only certain fields in a document, while leaving the rest of the document as-is. It takes the document path pointing to the document that should be updated and a body of changes. For example, if the body is set to the following:

```json
{
    "name": "Eve"
}
```

Then the value of `name` field in the document pointed by path will be changed to `"Eve"`, but no other fields in the document will be changed.

Values of nested fields should be set in the form of field paths. For example, consider the following document that's already saved in our Firestore:

```json
{
    "name": {
        "first": "Sherlock",
        "last": "Holmes"
    },
    "role": "Detective"
}
```

Say we want to update the first name to `"Mycroft"`, but leave the rest of the document (including last name) intact. Then the body in the update method should be:

```json
{
    "name.first": "Mycroft"
}
```

This will update just the `name.first` field, which is what we wanted.

Note that this method can only update a single document at once. Firestore doesn't provide a way to bulk-update multiple documents at once.

### Deleting Document

The "Delete Document" method deletes the document at the given path. Deleting a document by giving a non-existing path is **NOT** treated as an error.

## Taking Inputs from Widgets

All querying/modifying methods discussed above can take inputs from widgets using our Mustache-like syntax, for example **`{{ searchInput.text }}`** where **searchInput** is the name of the widget and **text** is the property of the widget.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to wrap your params with double quotes to produce valid JSON.
{% endhint %}

```json
{
    "name": "{{ nameInput.text }}"
}
```

## Displaying Query Data

Query data can be displayed in a table or chart using the Mustache-like syntax **`{{ queryName.data }}`**. You can read more about displaying query data below.

{% hint style="info" %}
The widgets are automatically refreshed when the data is changed.
{% endhint %}
