# Connect to APIs

{% hint style="success" %}
If your API is not available on the public internet, you must expose it via a service such as [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)
{% endhint %}

## API Editor

The API pane is a REST interface that allows you to create and modify your existing APIs. All REST HTTP methods are supported and API values can be configured in the headers, params, and body fields

## Importing CURL Commands

Appsmith makes it easy to import your APIs into your application using CURL commands.

## Authentication

If your backend has a standard set of headers or parameters that need to be sent with every request, you can save these as a common data source. Simply click the save as data source option at the end of the URL and add the common parameters.
