# Connect to APIs

{% hint style="success" %}
If your API is not available on the public internet, you must expose it via a service such as [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)
{% endhint %}

## API Editor

The API pane is a REST interface that allows you to create and modify your existing APIs. All REST HTTP methods are supported and API values can be configured in the headers, params, and body fields
