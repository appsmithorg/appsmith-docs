# Execute Queries

You can write queries to fetch and update data from a database using the query editor interface provided by Appsmith for each database type. This article assumes you have already [connected to your database](./).

## **Setting up a Query**

Go to the page that needs to run this query.

1. Go to **DB** **Queries → +**.
2. Choose the connected database and click +New Query
3. You will be taken to the query editor to write the query.
4. Note that the query is created with a default name. It’s recommended that you rename it for readability and access.
5. Write your query in the syntax that is valid for your [database type](./#supported-databases).

{% hint style="success" %}
Queries are auto-saved so you never lose your work. These changes will be reflected in your published application only after you deploy.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
A query and its results can be accessed from only the page that it is a part of. To use a query on another page, click the context menu next to the query name and clone it.
{% endhint %}

### **Naming a Query**

A query must have a unique name that acts as an identifier. It is used to access the query results. In that sense, a name is like a variable in a programming language. You can access the various properties of the query results object using the query’s name.

```text
{{ query1.data }}
```

### **Running a query**

Click on the Run button to execute a query. If the query execution succeeds, a success message will pop up on the screen in the top right corner along with the results below the query.

#### Query results object

All queries return an array of objects where each object is a row returned by the query and each property in the object is a column. This object is immutable and cannot be changed by javascript.

## Using Queries in applications

Once you have successfully run a Query, you can use it in your application to

* [Display Data](../../displaying-data-read/)
* [Capture Data](../../capturing-data-write/)
