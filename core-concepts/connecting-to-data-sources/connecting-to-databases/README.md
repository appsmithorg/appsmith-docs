# Connect to Databases

## Supported Databases

* [DynamoDB](../../../datasource-reference/querying-dynamodb.md)
* [ElasticSearch](../../../datasource-reference/querying-elasticsearch.md)
* [Firestore](../../../datasource-reference/querying-firestore.md)
* [MongoDB](../../../datasource-reference/querying-mongodb/)
* [MS SQL](../../../datasource-reference/querying-mssql.md)
* [MySQL](../../../datasource-reference/querying-mysql.md)
* [PostgreSQL](../../../datasource-reference/querying-postgres.md)
* [Redis](../../../datasource-reference/querying-redis.md)
* [Redshift](../../../datasource-reference/querying-redshift.md)

## Security

Appsmith safely encrypts all your database credentials and stores them securely. Appsmith also does not store any data returned from your data sources and acts only as a proxy layer to orchestrate the API / Query calls. Since Appsmith is an open-source framework, you can [deploy it on-premise](../../../setup/), and audit it to ensure none of your data leaves your VPC.

## Connecting to a Database

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before connecting to a data source, you may need to whitelist the IP address of the Appsmith deployment on your database instance or VPC.

18.223.74.85 and 3.131.104.27 are the IP addresses of the Appsmith cloud instances that need to be whitelisted.

{% endhint %}

Once the appsmith instance has been [whitelisted](../aws-whitelist.md):

1. Go to **DB Queries** on that page.
2. Click on **+** next to **DB Queries**
3. Youâ€™ll see a list of existing Datasources that this page can connect to
4. Click on **+** **New Datasource**
5. Choose a Database from the [supported list](./#supported-databases)
6. Provide the configuration details required to connect to your database. You may need to contact your database admin.
7. Click on **Test** to verify that Appsmith is able to connect to your database using the details provided by you
8. **Save** your connection

{% hint style="success" %}
Databases configured within one page of an app can be accessed by developers anywhere within the organization
{% endhint %}

## General Notes

Appsmith creates a new connection pool with the database server when you first connect the database server to your app. All subsequent queries executed by Appsmith against your database then re-use this connection to ensure that at run-time your queries are executed quickly. In the case that an idle connection is closed by the database server, Appsmith creates a new connection while executing the next query.

For certain plugins like PostgreSQL, and MySQL, Appsmith creates and maintains a connection pool because multiple queries cannot be executed against a single connection.

### Concurrent queries

Appsmith limits maximum queries that can run concurrently on a database to be 5. If the application attempts to make more queries concurrently, you'll see an error saying `Connection not available`.
