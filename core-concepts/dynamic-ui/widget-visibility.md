# Controlling Widget Visibility

The visibility property is usually a switch in the property pane of every widget. This property can be made dynamic by clicking the JS button next to the property which converts it to a text field. Inside the text, the value of the visibility can be conditionally set using javascript.

## Control Visibility with other widgets

In the example below the visibility of the table is a conditional value based on the selected value of the RadioGroup

```text
{{RadioGroup1.selectedOptionValue === "Visible"}}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Visible property expects the expression to evaluate to a boolean value
{% endhint %}

## Control Visibility with API/Query responses

Similar to the above example, we can tie the visibility of a widget to the response of an API/Query.

```text
{{ API1.data.value === "trueValue" }}
```

## Dynamic Forms

There are some cases that require form fields to dynamically change based on the user input. This can be achieved using a Tab widget inside the form and conditionally updating the selected tab value based on the inputs of the form

{% hint style="success" %}
Hide the tabs in the tab widget to make it look like the views are changing in place
{% endhint %}
