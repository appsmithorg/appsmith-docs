{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

### **Connection**

You need to fill in the following parameters:

* **Region\*:** Select the region where your DynamoDB instance exists
* **Host Address / Port\*:** Fill in the database hostâ€™s address and port
* **AWS Access Key Id\*:** The identifier for your AWS Access key that is configured to have access to this database
* **AWS Secret Access Key\*:** The secret key for this identifier 

## Querying DynamoDB

DynamoDB databases can be queried using any of the operations that are [officially supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_DynamoDB.html). The request body expects a JSON object that represents a map of parameters to query the database.

## Taking Inputs from Widgets

Queries can take inputs from widgets using javascript inside the query and referencing the widget property. Open `{{ }}` inside the query to write javascript and access other entities on the page using their names.
