The following document assumes that you understand the [basics of connecting to databases on Appsmith](../../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases.md). If not, please go over them before reading further.


## Connection Settings

Appsmith needs the following parameters for connecting to a Mongo database:

> All required fields are suffixed with an asterisk \(\*\).


### **Connection**

You need to fill in the following parameters:

* **Connection Mode\*:** You must choose one of the following two modes:
  * **Read Only:** Choosing this mode gives Appsmith read-only permission on the database. This allows you to only fetch data from the database. 
  * **Read / Write:** Choosing this mode gives Appsmith both read and write permissions on the database. This allows you to execute all CRUD queries.
* **Connection Type\*:** You must choose one of the following connection types:
  * **Direct Connection**: Choose this connection type to connect directly to a mongo instance
  * **Replicate Set**: Choose this connection type to connect to a set of mongo instances.
* **Host Address / Port\*:** Fill in the database host’s address and port. If you don’t specify a port, Appsmith

  will try to connect to port 27017. You can specify multiple host addresses for a replicate set. In case you have

  an [SRV URL](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format) please follow [these](./#connect-using-srv-url) steps to connect to your mongodb instance.

* **Default** **Database Name\*:** Fill in the name of the database that you want to connect to. This is your database’s name in your mongo server.

#### Connect using SRV URL

* Set `Connection Type` field to `Replica set`.
* An [SRV URL](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format) is of

  the format \`mongodb+srv://:&lt;your\_password&gt;@/?

  authSource=…\` . Please extract and copy the fields as below:

  * `<connection_url>` to the `Host Address` field
  * `<defaultDbName>` to the `Default Database Name` field
  * `<your_username>` to the `Username` field
  * `<your_password>` to the `Password` field
  * `<authDbName>` to the `Database Name` field under the `Authentication` sub-section.

### **Authentication**

You need to fill in the following parameters:

* **Database Name:** Fill in the name of the database against which you want to authenticate. This is typically admin for most MongoDB instances.
* **Authentication Type\*:** Choose the authentication mechanism with which to connect to your database. This can be one of `SCRAM-SHA-1`, `SCRAM-SHA-256`, `MONGO-CR`.
* **Username:** Fill username required for authenticating connection requests to your database. Set this to empty if you won't want to specify a username to authenticate with.
* **Password:** Fill password required for authenticating connection requests for the given username to the database. Set this to _empty_ if you want to login without a password \(please ensure your database accepts such connections\).

### **SSL**

The SSL Mode can be set to one of the following values:

* **`Default`**: Depends on Connection Type. If using `Replica set`, this is `Enabled`. If using `Direct connection`, this is `Disabled`.
* **`Enabled`**: Reject connection, if SSL is not available.
* **`Disabled`**: Connect without SSL, use a plain unencrypted connection.

## Querying Mongo \(Form Input\)

For an easy to use interface to query your mongo database, choose `Form input`.

As part of Form Input, Appsmith supports queries like `Find one or more documents`, `Insert a document`, `Update one`, `Count` etc.

All mongo queries return an array of objects where each object is a mongo document and properties of the object are the keys of the document.

### 1. Find Document\(s\)

This command selects documents in a collection or view. Following fields are supported in Appsmith for this command :

`Collection Name` : The name of the collection or view to query. The input is expected in a string format like the following :

```text
restaurants
```

`Query` : The query predicate. If unspecified, then all documents in the collection will match the predicate. The input is expected in JSON/BSON format like the following :

```text
{
     rating: { $gte: 9 }, 
     cuisine: "italian" 
}
```

`Sort` : \(Optional\) The sort specification for the ordering of the results. The input is expected in JSON/BSON format like the following :

```text
{ name: 1 }
```

`Projection` : \(Optional\) The projection specification to determine which fields to include in the returned documents. The input is expected in JSON/BSON format like the following :

```text
{ name: 1, rating: 1, address: 1 }
```

`Limit` : \(Optional\) The maximum number of documents to return. If unspecified, then defaults to 10 documents. The input is expected in number format :

```text
10
```

`Skip` : \(Optional\) Number of documents to skip. Defaults to 0. The input is expected in number format :

```text
0
```

### 2. Insert Document\(s\)

This command inserts one or more documents and returns a document containing the status of all inserts. Following fields are supported in Appsmith for this command :

`Collection Name` : The name of the target collection. The input is expected in a string format like the following :

```text
users
```

`Documents` : An array of one or more documents to insert into the named collection. The input is expected in a JSON/BSON Array format like the following :

```text
[ { _id: 1, user: "abc123", status: "A" } ]
```

### 3. Update Document\(s\)

This command modifies multiple documents in a collection. Following fields are supported in Appsmith for this command :

`Collection Name` : The collection against which to run the command. The input is expected in a string format like the following :

```text
people
```

`Query` : The query that matches documents to update. The input is expected in JSON/BSON format like the following :

```text
{ name: "Andy" }
```

`Update` : The modifications to apply. The input is expected in JSON/BSON format like the following :

```text
{ $inc: { score: 1 } }
```

`Limit` : The dropdown is used to configure if this delete command should act upon a single document or if this command should delete all the matching documents according to the query.

### 4. Delete Document\(s\)

This command removes documents from a collection. Following fields are supported in Appsmith for this command :

`Collection Name` : The target collection against which to run the command. The input is expected in a string format like the following :

```text
orders
```

`Query` : The query that matches document\(s\) to delete. The input is expected in JSON/BSON format like the following :

```text
{ status: "D" }
```

`Limit` : The dropdown is used to configure if this delete command should act upon a single document or if this command should delete all the matching documents according to the query.

### 5. Count

This command counts the number of documents in a collection or a view. Returns a document that contains this count. Following fields are supported in Appsmith for this command :

`Collection Name` : The name of the collection or view to count. The input is expected in a string format like the following :

```text
orders
```

`Query` : A query that selects which documents to count in the collection or view. The input is expected in JSON/BSON format like the following :

```text
{ ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2021') }
```

### 6. Distinct

{ dept: "A"} }
```

`Key/Field` : The field for which to return distinct values. The input is expected in a string format like the following :

```text
item.sku
```

### 7. Aggregate

This command performs aggregation operation using the aggregation pipeline. The pipeline allows users to process data from a collection or other source with a sequence of stage-based manipulations. Following fields are supported in Appsmith for this command :

`Collection Name` : The name of the collection or view that acts as the input for the aggregation pipeline. The input is expected in a string format like the following :

```text
articles
```

`Array of Pipelines` : An array of aggregation pipeline stages that process and transform the document stream as part of the aggregation pipeline. The input is expected in JSON/BSON array format like the following :

```text

      { $unwind: "$tags" },
      { $group: { _id: "$tags", count: { $sum : 1 } } }
]
```

The above example performs an aggregate operation on the articles collection to calculate the count of each distinct element in the tags array that appears in the collection.

## Querying Mongo \(Advanced\)

For unlocking the power of mongo commands, query your mongo database using the RAW command. For the same, choose `Raw Input`

{% hint style="warning" %}
The mongo database command syntax is slightly different from the mongo collection methods you may be familiar with. [Read more](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/nav-crud/)

Mongo by default returns only 101 records due to its default [batchSize](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/iterate-a-cursor/). This can be updated by setting the limit and batchSize fields to higher values in your query


All mongo queries return an array of objects where each object is a mongo document and properties of the object are the keys of the document.

Appsmith provides template queries to help with the syntax

* [Insert Query](mongo-syntax.md#insert-query)
* [Find Query](mongo-syntax.md#find-query)
* [Update Query](mongo-syntax.md#update-query)
* [Delete Query](mongo-syntax.md#delete-query)

## Using Queries in applications

Once you have successfully run a Query, you can use it in your application to

* [Display Data](../../core-concepts/displaying-data-read/)
* [Capture Data](../../core-concepts/capturing-data-write/)
