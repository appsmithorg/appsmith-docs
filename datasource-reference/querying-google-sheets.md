  Appsmith Google Sheet Integration (Beta) lets us build powerful applications
  by connecting to any Google Sheet as a data source.
---

# Google Sheets

This integration is present under API sections with Appsmith applications. Using this, one can achieve all the basic operations \(CRUD\) with a custom UI on Appsmith by minimal configuration within multiple sheets \(sub-sheets\) on a Google Sheet.

### Connection Settings

To use this plugin, select the Google Sheets option on API creation page and then click on the `Create Datasource`. This will redirect to the config page, where scopes can be configured. You can create a Google Sheets data source with one of either of the two permission scopes listed below:

1. **`Read and Write`:** This scope allows you to use all the methods available within Appsmith's Google Sheets integration. You will be asked to provide read and write access to your Google Sheets as well as Google Drive.
2. **`Read Only`:** This scope allows limited access to methods that would list or read your Google Sheets. In order to use this scope, you must provide read access to both Google Sheets and Google Drive.

On completing authorization, you will be redirected back to the data source page. From here, you can create a new API to use this authorized data source.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Creating and authorizing a Google Sheets data source will store your own personal credentials within the Appsmith servers. When you share your application with more developer or administrators, your Google sheets account will be accessible to them.
{% endhint %}
