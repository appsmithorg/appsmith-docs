The following document assumes that you understand the [basics of connecting to databases on Appsmith](../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases/). If not, please go over them before reading further.

{% hint style="success" %}
All required fields are suffixed with an asterisk \(\*\).
{% endhint %}

### **Connection**

You need to fill in the following parameters:

* **Connection Mode\*:** You must choose one of the following two modes:
  * **Read Only:** Choosing this mode gives Appsmith read-only permission on the database. This allows you to only fetch data from the database. 
  * **Read / Write:** Choosing this mode gives Appsmith both read and write permissions on the database. This allows you to execute all CRUD queries.
* **Host Address / Port\*:** Fill in the database host’s address and port. If you don’t specify a port, Appsmith will try to connect to port 5432.
* **Database Name\*:** Fill in the name of the database that you want to connect to. This is your database’s name.

### **Authentication**

You need to fill in the following parameters:

* **Username\*:** Fill username required for authenticating connection requests to your database.
* **Password\*:** Fill password required for authenticating connection requests for the given username to the database. 

### **SSL**

You need to fill in the following parameters:

* **SSL Mode:** Choose your SSL model from the dropdown. 
* **Key File:** Upload your SSL key file from here.
* **Certificate:** Upload your SSL certificate here**.**
* **CA Certificate:** Upload your CA certificate here.
* **PEM Certificate:** Upload your PEM certificate here.
* **PEM Passphrase:** Fill in your PEM passphrase here.

## Querying Postgres

PostgreSQL databases can be queried using the standard [SQL syntax](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/index.html). All PostgreSQL queries return an array of objects where each object is a row returned by the query and each property in the object is a column.

## Using Queries in applications

Once you have successfully run a Query, you can use it in your application to

* [Display Data](../core-concepts/displaying-data-read/)
* [Capture Data](../core-concepts/capturing-data-write/)
