# Enabling Third Party Services

{% hint style="success" %}
All third party services are enabled by default in our [cloud hosted](https://appsmith.com) version
{% endhint %}

## Enabling Services for Self Hosting

Our self-hosted version allows you to configure your own keys to enable third party services such as Google OAuth. To enable a service, simply open the folder of your appsmith installation and edit the **docker.env** file.

You may need root access to modify the docker.env file

Restart docker and nginx using the following command

```text
sudo docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith-internal-server nginx && sudo docker-compose up -d 
```

## Configuring Third Party Services

Each service requires a specific key or configuration to be enabled. Configure the service of your choice using the following guides

* [Email](third-party-services/email/)
* [Google OAuth](third-party-services/google-login.md)
* [Github OAuth](third-party-services/github-login.md)
* [Google Maps](third-party-services/google-maps.md)
