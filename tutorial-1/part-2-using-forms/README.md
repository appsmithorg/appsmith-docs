# Part 2: Using forms

This tutorial begins where [Tutorial 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MF52io4nymFJoeAoKQnOlovHMtwh5qbk0kRb9rNU1fI/edit#heading=h.rc9ynztdksa4) left off where you created a single page app to view products. In this part, you'll extend the app to a multi-page app. You'll create a new page that allows users to add a new product to the catalog. During this you'll learn to:

1. Create a new page having a form to accept the new product's details from a user
2. Add validations to the form fields
3. Access widget's state in queries to insert dynamic input
4. Bind the form's submit button to trigger the addition of a new product
5. Finally, add a button on the **ProductListPage** that opens this form
