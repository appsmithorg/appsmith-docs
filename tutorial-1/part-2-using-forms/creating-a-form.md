# Creating your first form

Let's first create a new page that will have a form to accept product-details from users:

1. Click on **+** next to **Pages** to add a new page
2. Rename the page from **Page1** to **NewProductPage**
3. Click on **+** next to **Widgets**
4. Drag and drop the **Form** **Widget** from the left pane to **NewProductPage**
5. Rename the form to **AddProductForm**

{% hint style="info" %}
**App structure:**

When you create a new page, the base directory structure having Widgets, APIs, and DB Queries automatically gets created.
{% endhint %}

## Using an input widget

You'll first drag and drop the [form widget](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/form) **to** create an empty form on your page. Now, let’s add some fields in the form to take user input:

1. Drag and drop the [input widget](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/input) into the form
2. Rename the **input widget** to **ProductNameInput**

Your form will look like below:

This looks incomplete without a text label on its left. Let’s fix that:

1. Drag and drop the [text widget](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/text) next to the left of **ProductNameInput**
2. Update the **Text** property from its properties modal to **Product Name:** to change the display text

Let’s tinker with **ProductNameInput**:

1. Open its properties
2. Set **Data Type** to **Text** 
3. Enable **Required** field

The **Data Type** property sets the allowed data-type of input. When set to **Text**, it allows only **Text** input. The **Required** field makes the input to the field mandatory. It also disables the form-submit button if no input is provided in a mandatory field. The input widget has [many other properties available](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/input#properties).

## Using a dropdown widget

Let’s add other fields to the form. To enable users to choose a Category:

1. Drag-drop a [dropdown widget](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/dropdown)
2. Rename it to **CategoryDropdown**
3. Set its **Select** **Type** to **Single Select**
4. Add a [text widget](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/text) next to **CategoryDropdown** 
5. Set its **Text** property to **Category:**

By setting the **Selection Type** to **Single Select**, you allow the user to select only one value from the dropdown. You can alternatively configure a multi-select dropdown by choosing Multi Select from Selection Type. However, to do this tutorial, choose **Single Select** only.

Note the **Categorydropdown**. It’s showing the options as - Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, and Vegan. These are its default options. Let’s change them to what's relevant to Oakry, that is - Vegetables, Bakery, Fruits, Beverages, and Dairy.

1. Open **CategoryDropdown**’s properties modal.
2. Click on the **Options** field. The value in this field is used to specify the options of the dropdown.
3. Note the floating window show up when you place the cursor in **Options** field.
4. See that the **Expected Data Type** is **Array&lt;{ label: string, value: string }&gt;**

   . You'll need to specify the options in the same format.

5. Set the **Options** field to that shown below.
6. Set the **Default Option** to blank. This will keep the default selected option to blank.
7. Toggle the **Required** field to true. This makes the input to the dropdown a required field.

```text
[
  {
    "label": "VEGETABLES",
    "value": "VEGETABLES"
  },
  {
    "label": "BAKERY",
    "value": "BAKERY"
  },
  {
    "label": "FRUITS",
    "value": "FRUITS"
  },
    {
    "label": "BEVERAGES",
    "value": "BEVERAGES"
  },
  {
    "label": "DAIRY",
    "value": "DAIRY"
  }
]
```

## Writing your first transformation

Notice that to set **CategoryDropdown**'s options, you had to copy-paste the values in a text editor. It was cumbersome. You can use JavaScript to simplify that:

1. Open **CategoryDropdown**’s properties
2. Copy-paste the following in its **Options** field: `{ { _.map(['vegetables', 'bakery', 'fruits', 'beverages', 'dairy'], function (category) { return { label: category.toUpperCase(), value: category.toUpperCase() } }) } }`
3. Check the **Evaluated Value**. Verify that it matches the **Expected Data Type**.

You used the `_.map` method of **Lodash**, and `toUpperCase()` method of JavaScript to transform **Array&lt;Strings&gt;** into **Array&lt;{ label: string, value: string }&gt;** a format understood by the dropdown widget, instead of manually formatting it.

By extension, you can transform any data into the desired format and type. For example, your input array can be values returned by a query, that you then transform to **Array&lt;{ label: string, value: string }&gt;ho** so the drodown can show it.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Data Transformation:**

A transformation is nothing but JavaScript running on a base object to generate another object with the desired values, and in the desired format. Since you can Appsmith supports JavaScript just about everywhere, you can use JavaScript, or one of the [supported JS libraries](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-ui-and-logic/working-with-js-libraries#included-js-libraries) to transform data in any widget, API, or a DB Query.
{% endhint %}

## Adding other fields

Let's add a field to accept input for Mrp:

1. Add an [input widget](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/input)
2. Rename it **MrpInput**
3. Change its **Data Type** to **Number**
4. Add a [text widget](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/text) next to **MrpInput** 
5. Set its **Text** property to MRP\($\):

The title of the form is a text widget. Let's rename the title from **Form**. to **Add a Product**:

The **AddProductForm** now looks like this:

![AddProductForm: Form to add a new product](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%283%29%20%283%29%20%281%29.png)

## Writing regex validations

Your form now has all the required widgets in place with some basic properties configured. Let’s add some regex validations to reject bad input from users.

Start with **ProductNameInput**:

1. Open its properties modal 
2. Set **Regex** to `^\s*[a-zA-Z]{3,50}\s*$`
3. Set **Error Message** to **Must be alphanumeric having length between 3 and 50**

Let’s see what you did there:

* By setting the **Regex**: 
  * You restricted the text to the characters of the English alphabet
  * You ensured that the length of the product name will at least be 3 and at most be 50
* By setting the **Error Message**, you specified the error users will see when regex validation on their input fails

Try filling in both valid and invalid values in **ProductNameInput** to verify that it works.

Now, let’s configure MrpInput to accept only decimal values greater than or equal to $1.00

1. Set **Regex** to `^\s*(?=.*[1-9])\d*(?:\.\d{1,2})?\s*$`
2. Set **Error Message** to **Value must be greater than 0 and up to 2 decimal places**

Verify that the regex validates the input as expected, and throws the error message in case of a mismatch.

**Real-time app changes:**

Since Appsmith editor reflects changes in the app in real-time. So you will be able to test the changes while building, and without having to deploy every time.
