# Creating your First Page

Now that your environment – an "**app**" – is set up, you’re ready to start doing work.

> A page in Appsmith is where the three building blocks of your app - Widgets, APIs, and DB Queries come together to create a view.

The first page you create will list all the products at Oakry. Let's use the default page **Page1** that was created when you created this app. Now, rename the page to **ProductListPage** by double-clicking on **Page1**.

## Adding your First Widget

As discussed in the previous sections, Widgets are simple UI Components that can be added to our Apps. Now, let's add a table-widget under the **`ProductListPage`** by following the below steps:

1. Navigate to **Widgets Directory** under `ProductListPage`
2. Click on `+`
3. Find the `Table` widget
4. Drag and drop it to the canvas on the right

This will create a new table on `ProductListPage`.

Let's discuss what has happened now:

* As soon as you add a new `Table` widget, you should see some pre-populated data.
* A floating window, titled **`Table1`**, open's up on the right of the table. This is the widget's property-pane; here, you can configure the widget's properties.
* The `Table Data` property in the pane defines what data will be displayed on the table. You can read more about the table widget's properties in the [Table widget reference](https://docs.appsmith.com/widget-reference/table).
* By default, the name of the table is set to **Table1**. It can be renamed to anything you like by simply double-clicking it. Let's now change it to **`Products_Table`**.

### Understanding the Table Widget

Let's now take a minute to check how the array in `Table Data` maps to the table's columns and their values.

Here are steps to play with **Table Data** to get a hang of how it affects the data displayed in the table:

1. First, go to **Table Data** property of **`Products_Table`**.
2. Copy-paste the below JSON data. 
3. The above step will update the existing pre-populated data. You'll see the updated table.
4. You can always change the values, to test it quickly, go to the first object of the array and update the value of the key `one` from `1` to `i`.
5. Verify that column **one** of the first row of the table now shows `i`.
6. Click on the **Deploy** button on the top right.

```text
[
  { "one": "1", "two": "2" },
  { "one": "I", "two": "II" }
]
```

Open the application's URL in your web browser. You should see the values of your table like the below screenshot:

{% hint style="info" %}

Let's go back to the `Table Data` field. When you place your cursor in the Table Data field, you see a floating window consisting of two properties:

1. `Expected Data Type`: This field specifies the data-type expected by the property field. For the table widget, the **Expected Data Type** is `Array<Object>`. Meaning the values can be set to anything that either is or evaluates to Table Object.
2. `Evaluated Value`: This field shows in real-time what the input to the field evaluates to. This comes in handy when you write JavaScript code in the field, and you want to check whether it evaluates as expected.

By now, you have successfully displayed static data in your table. In the next section, we'll display product data from the mock database for the **Oakry** app.

However, when you are building an app for a different use-case, you can connect to your own database. Check out the [docs here](../../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/) to learn to configure a database of your choice.

## Writing your First Query

Now, let's utilise the mock database to display all the catalogue items for the **Oakry** app by following the below steps:

1. First, let's create a new **DB Query** by clicking on the **"+"** icon next to **DB Queries** directory.
2. Choose **Mock Database**, also you can see that this is a PostgreSQL database.
3. Next, click on the _**New Query**_ button, you’ll see a query created with the name **Query1**
4. Rename the query to **ProductsQuery**, by double-clicking on the existing one.
5. Next, click on create option and replace the query shown below in the **Query** tab
6. Click on the **Run** button, this will execute your query and prints out all the results below

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "productName", "category", "mrp" FROM products ORDER BY "id";
   ```

The query is saved as soon as it's created, without you having to explicitly save it. The same would be the case with any API, widgets, and any changes you make you any entity of your app.

Below is a screenshot of how Appsmith renders the outputs of SQL Query.

## Accessing Query Results to a Widget

The next step is to display the query results in the `Products_Table`, follow the below steps to do the same:

1. Navigate back to _Widgets_ under `ProductListPage` and select the `Products_Table`
2. Open `Product_Table` properties, and copy the following property to `Table Data`

```text
{{ProductsQuery.data}}
```

Here, we are accessing the entire query object by using the query name: `ProductsQuery`, the `.data` method allows us to attach data.

> Using the flower brackets `{{ }}` you’re asking Appsmith to resolve what is within it as JavaScript code. You can write JavaScript anywhere in Appsmith using `{{ }}`.

Setting **Table Data** to `{{ ProductsQuery.data }}` also ensures that whenever **ProductListPage** loads, **ProductsQuery** runs automatically. You can, although, change this default behaviour by toggling the field "**Run query on page load**" on the **Setting** tab of **ProductsQuery**.

Now, you should see your table displays the `ProductsQuery` results. You can also deploy this and share it to display the product catalogue for the Oakry app.

Below is the screenshot:

## Reactive Programming

Appsmith follows the [Reactive Programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming).

In reactive programming, when you set `a := b + c`, the value of `a` is automatically updated whenever the values of `b` or `c` change, without the program having to re-execute the statement to determine the presently assigned value of `a`.

As against imperative programming, where after `a` is assigned the result of `b + c` in the instant the expression is evaluated, later the values of `b` and `c` can change with no effect on the value of `a`.

Let's extend this to what you did in the previous section by setting:

```text
Table Data of Products_Table := {{ ProductsQuery.data }}
```

The data displayed on **Products\_Table** will be updated automatically, whenever **ProductsQuery** is run, i.e. without you having to write explicit code to re-evaluate **TableData** of **Products\_Table**.

So, in Appsmith, whenever you bind a field to a dynamic variable, the field's value will be automatically updated when the value of the dynamic variable changes.

## Variables and Names

In the previous sections, we've used names to access widgets and queries. For example, you accessed a query's result by accessing a property on the query's name. In that sense, think of widgets, APIs and DB Queries in Appsmith as variables having a name. Similar to variables in other programming languages:

1. They represent an object, be it a widget, an API object, or a query object
2. They support a set of methods
3. They have a scope; they can be accessed from only within their parent page
4. All names within a page must be unique - be it widget names, query name, or API names.

As you'll see in the next section, the inverse of this is also possible, i.e a widget's state can also be accessed by a query. Furthermore, all the building blocks of an Appsmith page - Widgets, DB Queries, and APIs can access each other's data and/or state using their names.

When you’re comfortable with the basics of using the table-widget, setting up a DB query, and connecting the widget to display query results, read [part 2 ](https://app.gitbook.com/@appsmith/s/appsmith/~/drafts/-MNXsPmxVacsRbqB7S_f/v/v1.3/tutorial/part-2-creating-a-basic-form)of the tutorial to learn to use widgets that enable you to accept and process user input.
