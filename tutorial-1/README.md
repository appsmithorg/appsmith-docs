# Tutorial

Through this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a Grocery Catalog application for an online grocery store called Oakry. The application is a multi-page dashboard used by Oakry’s Catalog Managers to:

* Browse the product catalog
* Add new products to the catalog
* Update the details of products in the catalog

The tutorial is organized into three parts & we recommend you follow them in order. 

You must have an account on either [Appsmith Cloud](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#appsmith-cloud) or your own[ private instance](../setup/) before getting started.
