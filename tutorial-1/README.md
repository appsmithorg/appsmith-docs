# Tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to build a feature-complete **Grocery Catalog** application for an online grocery store called Oakry using [Appsmith](https://app.appsmith.com/). The application we will be building is a multi-page dashboard used by Oakryâ€™s Catalog Managers to:

* Browse the product catalog
* Add new products to the catalog
* Update the details of products in the catalog

The tutorial is organized into three parts & we recommend you follow them in order.

You must have an account on either [Appsmith Cloud](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#appsmith-cloud) \(it's free\) or your own[ private instance](../setup/) before getting started.
