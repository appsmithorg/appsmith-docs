## Pull request
You would have to branch out from the ```main``` branch. Make changes to the existing documents or add a new document in this branch. Once you're happy, create a pull request[PR].

It's recommended that you add the ticket number to the branch name, so it's easy to follow when reviewing the changes.

> Please ensure that a doc ticket is raised. If not, please use one of the available [issue types](#types) to submit an issue.

### Raising a new document pull request
You should raise a pull request[PR] for adding the first draft by creating a folder structure in the appropriate directory structure of the documentation hierarchy.

For example, you are working on adding the first draft for SSO - OIDC integration with AWS Cognito. Then, you would add the new documentation page in the below documentation hierarchy:

filename - aws-cognito.md
hierarchy - website/docs/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/authentication/openid-connect-oidc

Write your first draft, raise a pull request against the ```main``` branch, and assign it to the appropriate stakeholders (engineering team members) for review. 

Once the review is completed, update the documentation ticket with the link to the PR and the loom video, and assign the ticket to the documentation team.

> Please ensure that the PR is left open and not merged. Please link the issue to the PR.

The documentation team would work on the same PR to share the outline/refine the document by rewriting the content/adding videos/images.

### Raise an existing document change pull request
You should raise a pull request[PR] for adding changes to a current document in the appropriate directory structure of the documentation hierarchy.

For example, you are modifying docker documentation. Then, you should edit the file available in the below documentation hierarchy:

filename - README.md
hierarchy - website/docs/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/docker/README.md

Do the changes to the file and raise a pull request against the ```main``` branch, and assign it to the appropriate stakeholders (engineering team members and documentation team members) for review. 

> Please ensure that the PR is left open and not merged. Please link the issue to the PR.

The documentation team would refine the changes/structure and approve and merge the PR.

#### Approving and merging the pull request

The reviews would happen as part of the pull request, as pull request comments.
* You can apply the changes to the pull request[PR].
* As you apply changes to the PR, please mark the comments as resolved.
* You can verify the content changes as part of the deploy review, available on the conversation tab under the vercel section.

  ![Preview your changes](/website/static/img/Deploy-preview-Content-Changes.png)

* Once all the review comments are addressed, please re-request the review.

>  It's mandatory to accept the Contributor License Agreement [CLA]. Please ensure that you've signed and accepted the CLA.
