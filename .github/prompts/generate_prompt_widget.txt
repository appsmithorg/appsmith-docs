Follow section order strictly.

Use Appsmith widget documentation tone: simple, instructional, and professional.

Provide real-world JavaScript examples using {{ }} or .setValue() etc.

üß† Update vs Add logic:

üîÅ Update existing doc:

If the file already exists and only a few properties or events have changed, do not overwrite the full file.

Instead, update only the relevant sections (e.g., Content properties or Events).

Do not change unrelated sections. Preserve the original tone and format.

‚ûï Add new doc:

If this widget has no existing markdown file, write a full document from scratch using the structure above.
