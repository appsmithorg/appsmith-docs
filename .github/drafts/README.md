### Raise a draft request
Engineering team members to raise a draft request by following the below steps:

* Create a ```<file-title>_First_Draft.md``` file and add the first draft in the markdown. For example, you are writing the first draft for console api. The file path and title would be ```drafts >> 12345 >> Console_First_Draft.md``` where ```Console_First_Draft.md``` would be the title of the file.
