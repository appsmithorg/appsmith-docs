*** Category Slider ***

The Category Slider widget allows users to choose from a fixed set of incremental values.

# Properties

Properties allow you to edit the Category Slider widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description** | **Code Snippet** |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Options** | Formatting | An _array of objects_ with keys `value` and `label` which define the possible selections that the user can make with the slider. |  |
| **Default Value** | Formatting | Sets an initial option to be captured as user input unless it's changed by the user. This property should be set to match the `value` attribute of your desired option from the **Options** object. |  |
| **Show Marks** | Formatting | Toggles on/off the widget's reference labels below the slider element.  |  |
| **Visible** | Formatting | Controls widget's visibility on the page. When turned off: The widget won't be visible when the app is published. It appears translucent when in Edit mode. |  |
| **Disabled** | Formatting | Makes the widget un-clickable or unusable. The widget will remain visible to the user but user interaction won't be allowed. |  |
| **Animate Loading** | Formatting | When turned off, the widget will load without any skeletal animation. You can use a toggle switch to turn it on/off. You can also turn it off/on using JavaScript by enabling the JS label next to it. |  |
| **value** | Binding | Represents the value the value which is currently selected in the widget. | `{{<widget-name>.value}}` |

These properties allow you to perform formatting changes or bind it to any other widget in queries or JS objects.

### Options
Use the `Options` property to define the set of choices that the user may choose from with the slider. This property should be an array of objects, each with a `label` key (text to be displayed to the user) and a `value` key (the corresponding value to use within your widgets and code).

### value
This binding property allows you to access the value that has been selected with the slider. For example, if the selected value is `"agree"`, then the `value` property would look like:

```
{{CategorySlider1.value}}
// agree
```

# Events

Each variant of the Slider widget has events that are called when the user adjusts the widget's values:

| **Event** | **Description** | **Example** | **Code Snippet** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **onChange** | Sets an action to take place when the user changes the slider's value. Can be set from the GUI list of common actions (See a list of [supported actions](https://docs.appsmith.com/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions)), or you can define a custom JavaScript function to call instead. | Fetching a certain page or image from a range based upon user selection. |  |

# Conclusion
The Category Slider widget is great for collecting input that falls along a range of possible values. Consider using this widget when your users' responses are expected to fall along a fixed set of ascending data.
