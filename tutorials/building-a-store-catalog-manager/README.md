# Building a Store Catalog Manager

This tutorial shows you how to build a feature-complete **Grocery Catalog** application for an online grocery store  using [Appsmith](https://app.appsmith.com/). The application we will be building is a multi-page dashboard used by Oakry’s Catalog Managers to:

* Browse the product catalogue
* Add new products to the catalogue
* Update the details of products in the catalogue

The tutorial is organized into three parts & we recommend you follow them in order.

You must have an account on either [Appsmith Cloud](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#appsmith-cloud) \(it's free\) or your own[ private instance](../setup/) before getting started. Before diving in, let's talk a bit about the Appsmith environment.

## The Appsmith Environment

If this is your first time using Appsmith, you'll need to get acquainted with some initial setup. When you log in, you'll be redirected to [Appsmith Dashboard](https://app.appsmith.com/applications). This home-page has an auto-generated organization called **`<Your first-name> apps`** \(referred to as your personal organization from now on\) consisting of multiple templates. In this tutorial, we'll create our Catalog app under the same organization. 

Let's now create a new app named _Catalogue Dashboard_ under the personal organization.

> An app on Appsmith is a standalone software-application solving a specific use-case. It can consist of one or more web-pages.

Here are steps to create an app on Appsmith Dashboard:

1. Click on the _Create New_ button under your organization.
2. You’ll be redirected to the configuration page of the newly created app.
3. Note that the new app is created with the default name **Untitled Application 1**.
4. Rename it to **Catalog Dashboard** by double-clicking on the existing one.

The new app comes with auto-generated directories that establish an Appsmith app. Below is a screenshot of the directory structure.

> Entity Explorer is a place where you can create and organise UI widgets and data sources. Additionally, you can also find different integrations that you can utilise under these sections.

Let's see what each of these directories is:

* **`Pages`** : This directory is a container for all the web-pages and their configuration of your app. Under this directory, you can create and organize different pages based on the tool or application you're building.
* The **`Page1`** directory contains all entities required to render the corresponding web-page.

{% hint style="info" %}

* **`Widgets`**: This directory is a container for all the widgets that will be part of the web-page `Page1`. You can think of Widgets as simple UI Components for your web-page, for example, a data-picker or a form. By default, this directory doesn’t have any pre-configured widgets.
* **`Datasources`**: The datasources directory is a container consisting of all API's and queries that Page1 connects to.
* Lastly, you can also see all the [JS libraries supported by Appsmith](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-ui-and-logic/working-with-js-libraries#included-js-libraries) under _**JS libraries you can use**_ section below the `Page` directory. These libraries are already imported into your app's environment, ready to be used.

## Creating your First Page

Now that your environment – an "**app**" – is set up, you’re ready to start doing work.

> A page in Appsmith is where the three building blocks of your app - Widgets, APIs, and DB Queries come together to create a view.

The first page you create will list all the products. Let's use the default page **Page1** that was created when you created this app. Now, rename the page to **ProductListPage** by double-clicking on **Page1**.

In the next section, let's build a simple UI for our store manager.
