# Using forms

In the first part of this tutorial, you've created a single page app to view products for **Oakry**. In this part, you'll extend the app to a multi-page app, where you'll be creating a new page that allows users to add a new product to:

* Create a new page having a form to accept the new product's details from a user
* Add validations to the form fields
* Access widgets state in queries to insert dynamic input
* Bind the form's submit button to trigger the addition of a new product

We'll also add a button on the **ProductListPage** that opens this form. Let's get started!
