# Setup Server-side Searching on Table

This page shows you how to set up server-side searching on the Table widget, which allows you to refine query results based on specific search terms, without relying on the client-side. 

If you are using the one-click binding feature to connect data, Appsmith automatically generates a server-side searching query for you. However, if you prefer to manually configure the server-side setup, you can do so by following the instructions in this guide.

## Prerequisites

A [Table widget](/reference/widgets/table) connected to a query.


## Configure query

Most databases and APIs support server-side searching, although the methods of implementation can vary.

Configure the query to fetch data using the [searchText](/reference/widgets/table#searchtext-string) reference property.

<dd>

*Example:* if you want to search data based on user names:

* For PostgreSQL, you can configure the query as follows:


 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%{{Table1.searchText}}%' ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
 ```

This SQL query fetches rows from the `users` table where the `name` column partially matches the `searchText` input.

:::note
Ensure that you turn off prepared statements in the query editor for this configuration. For more details, see [Prepared Statements](/connect-data/concepts/how-to-use-prepared-statements).
:::

* For the REST API, configure the query parameter as shown in the URL:


   ```
   https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?name={{Table1.searchText}}
   ```


</dd>


## Configure Table widget

Follow these steps to configure the Table widget to display fetched data, and implement server-side searching:

1. Connect the query to the [**Table data**](/reference/widgets/table#table-data-arrayobject).

2. Enable the [**Allow searching**](/reference/widgets/table#allow-searching-boolean) property.

3. Set the [**onSearchTextChange**](/reference/widgets/table#onsearchtextchanged) event to run the query.

After completing these steps, you can search for specific terms using the Table widget's search box.
