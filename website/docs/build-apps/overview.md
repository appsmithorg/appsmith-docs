# Overview

Appsmith allows you to develop internal applications with streamlined integration of front-end and back-end. Built-in widgets serve as foundational blocks for dynamic app layouts, all customizable through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. 

You also have the ability to incorporate JavaScript to introduce logic, manipulate data, and create complex processes within widgets, queries, and various other elements. Themes ensure a consistent user experience across your apps, enhancing integration and usability.
