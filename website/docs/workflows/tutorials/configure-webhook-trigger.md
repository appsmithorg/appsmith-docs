 <div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "calc(50.520833333333336% + 41px)", height: "0", width: "100%" }}>
    <iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/1LnNGcbCRDlB2AKQpxz3?embed" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style={{ position: "absolute", top: "0", left: "0", width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "light" }} title="Appsmith | Configure webhook trigger">

1. Click the gear icon ⚙️ in the bottom left corner to configure the workflow settings.
2. Toggle the **Webhook trigger** property to configure the workflow as a webhook.
3. Copy and save the **URL**. If you wish to connect your workflow with an external app then you will need the **URL**. You'll see this in action in the [Send email using Postman](#send-email-using-postman) section.
4. Click the **Publish** button in the top right corner to publish your workflow.

You've configured the webhook trigger for the workflow. You can now integrate and trigger it from external apps.
