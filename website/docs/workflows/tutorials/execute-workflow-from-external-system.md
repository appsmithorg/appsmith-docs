# Lesson 4: Connect Workflow with External System

Connecting your Appsmith workflow to external systems, such as HTTPie, allows you to trigger actions and automate processes from outside the Appsmith environment. This is useful for integrating with other services or testing workflows in different scenarios.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Set up a new request in HTTPie.
* Use the webhook URL to trigger the workflow.
* Pass parameters to the workflow from HTTPie.
* Verify the workflow execution through HTTPie.

## What you'll need

Before you start, ensure you have:
* Completed [Lesson 3 - Configure Webhook Trigger](/workflows/tutorials/configure-webhook-trigger).
* Access to the [HTTPie web application](https://httpie.io/app) or any REST client for testing.

## Connect to external system

Follow these steps to connect workflow to external system:


1. Visit [https://httpie.io/app](https://httpie.io/app) in your web browser.

2. In the HTTPie web application, click the **New Request** button to create a new request.

3. Configure the request as shown below:
   - Set the request method to **POST**.
   - In the request URL field, paste the webhook URL you copied from workflow configuration in Lesson 3.
4. Pass parameters to Workflow by adding the parameters in the request body. Add the following JSON and replace `add_your_email_address` with your email:

      ```javascript
      {
            "email": "add_your_email_address"
      }

5. Click the **Send** button in the HTTPie web application to execute the request.
6. You should see a response in the HTTPie web application indicating that the workflow has been triggered successfully. The response may include a `workflowRunId` confirming the execution.

    ```json
    {
        "responseMeta": {
            "status": 200,
            "success": true
        },
        "data": {
            "workflowRunId": "XMXWTMOS"
        },
        "errorDisplay": ""
    }
    ```

7. Check your email inbox to confirm that the welcome email has been received. This step verifies that the workflow executed as expected.

ðŸš© Congratulations. You've successfully connected and triggered your Appsmith workflow using an external system, HTTPie. This capability enables you to integrate workflows with different external services, enabling automated processing across platforms.
