Appsmith Workflows are essential for automating tasks and orchestrating processes within applications. By integrating code-based and node-based systems, they provide a practical solution for automating tasks, managing workflows, enabling human-in-the-loop (HITL) interactions, and integrating with external services.

## Workflow capabilities

Appsmith Workflows are versatile and designed to handle a wide range of scenarios:

### Automate business-critical processes

Using app-building capabilities of Appsmith in workflows, developers can automate critical tasks based on business rules and requirements. From ticket assignments in customer support workflows to complex data processing operations, Workflows streamline processes efficiently.

### Enable Human-in-the-Loop interactions

Appsmith Workflows allow for human interventions within automated processes, facilitating informed decision-making through the Appsmith app. Decision points within workflows empower users to review and take appropriate actions, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of workflows.

## Explore trigger types

Appsmith supports different trigger types to configure actions and processes within workflows:

- **Webhook**- Triggered by external events or HTTP requests, Webhook triggers enable real-time data processing and action execution based on incoming data. Learn how to use the Webhook triggers in the [Getting started with workflows](#getting-started-with-workflows) tutorial.
  
- **Integrated Datasource for use in Appsmith Apps**- Seamlessly connect workflows with Appsmith applications using prebuilt integrations. This allows for seamless execution of operations within the app and direct management of workflows from the Appsmith interface. Delve deeper into integrated datasource triggers using Appsmith app in the [Getting started with workflows](#getting-started-with-workflows) tutorial.

- **Scheduled Jobs (Cron Jobs)**- Scheduled to run at specific times or intervals, Scheduled Jobs automate tasks using Cron expressions. Stay tuned for updates on the availability and usage of Scheduled Jobs within Appsmith. (**Coming Soon**)
