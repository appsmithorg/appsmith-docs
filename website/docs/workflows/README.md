Appsmith Workflows offer developers the capability to develop automations for their applications, as well as the ability to integrate human-in-the-loop (HITL) interactions. Developers can use Workflows to specify decision points within a process, enabling users to review and make informed decisions by taking appropriate actions.

## Workflow capabilities

Appsmith Workflows are long-running and designed to handle a variety of scenarios:

* **Automate business critical processes** - Automate critical tasks based on business rules and requirements, by leveraging Appsmith app-building capabilities like datasource integration, writing queries, and custom JavaScript code. For example, assigning a ticket to a customer support agent.
* **Enable Human-in-the-Loop Interactions** - Create decision points in Appsmith workflows for human interventions, and perform decision-making using Appsmith app. For example, enabling loan approvals or facilitating refunds.
