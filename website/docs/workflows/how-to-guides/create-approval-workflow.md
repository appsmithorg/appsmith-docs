In a human-in-the-loop approval workflow, such as processing refund requests, you can use workflows in Appsmith. The human intervention can happen through your Appsmith app. This page shows how to set up a human-in-the-loop approval workflow using Appsmith.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

* A self-hosted instance of Appsmith. Refer to the [Appsmith installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) for detailed instructions on setting up your Appsmith instance.
* Basic knowledge of creating a basic workflow in Appsmith. For more information, see [Tutorial - Create Basic Workflow](/workflows/tutorials/create-workflow).
* Configured your datasource that manages your data and SMTP datasource (to notify users) in your workspace. If not, configure these datasources. For more information on configuring datasource, see the available [Datasources](/connect-data/reference) in Appsmith.

## Create workflow

Follow these steps to set up a webhook workflow within your workspace. 

1. Create a new workflow (_Refunds_) in your workspace.
2. Configure it as a webhook workflow.
3. Create a query to fetch order details (_getOrderDetails_) details. For example, the below query fetches the order details for the given `order_id` from the `orders` table.
    ```sql
    -- The order_id is a parameter, and replaced by actual value passed by the application
    select * from public. "orders" where order_id = {{this.params.order_id}};
    ``` 
4. Create a query to update the order status on refund processing. For example, when user approves a refund request, update the order status in the `order` table to `Refund Processed`. In case of rejection, the order status remains unchanged.
    ```sql
    -- The order_id are parameters and replaced by actual value passed by the application
    -- highlight-next-line
    Update public. "orders" set status = 'Refund Processed' where order_id = {{this.params.order_id}};
    ```
5. Create queries to send emails to inform users of the outcome. For example, you can create two queries:
    *  To notify approval (_notifyUser_):
        * Parameterize the query to include:
            * Customer name (`{{this.params.customer_name}}`) who raised the request.
            * Customer email (`{{this.params.customer_email}}`) to send email notification. 
    * To notify rejection (_notifyRejectionToUser_):
        * Parameterize the query to include:
            * Customer name (`{{this.params.customer_name}}`) who raised the request.
            * Customer email (`{{this.params.customer_email}}`) to send email notification.
            * Rejection reason (`{{this.params.rejection_reason}}`). 
    * Pass these parameters from your app to the workflow.

6. Click the **Publish** button to publish the workflow.

## Create approval requests

Follow these steps to create refund requests which are awaiting user interaction: 

1. In your workflow, go to **Main** under _JS Objects_, and add the following function. This function generates a pending request using the `assignRequest` workflow function. For more information, see the [assignRequest](/workflows/reference/workflow-functions#assign-request) function. 
    ```javascript
    export default {
        async executeWorkflow(order) {
            const response = await appsmith.workflows.assignRequest({
                requestName: "getPendingRefundRequests", 
                message: "Refund raised by " + order.customer_name+ " for amount " + order.amount, 
                requestToUsers: [order.approver_email], 
                resolutions: ["Approve", "Reject"],
                metadata: { "order": order } 
            });

            if (response && response.resolution === "Approve") {
                //Add logic for refund processing if any
                // When user approves, execute the initiateRefund query 
                await initiateRefund.run({
                    "id": order.order_id,
                    "status": 'Refund Processed'
                });
                // Send refund approval email to the customer 
                await notifyUser.run({
                    "customer_email": refund_req.customer_email ,
                    "customer_name": refund_req.customer_name

                });
            } else if (resolution && response.resolution === "Reject") {
                // Send refund rejection email to the customer 
                // Supply the rejection reason as a parameter
                await notifyRejectionToUser.run({
                        "customer_email": refund_req.customer_email ,
                        "customer_name": refund_req.customer_name,
                        "rejection_reason": refund_req.rejection_reason
                    });
            }
        }
    }          
    ```
2. Click the **Publish** button to publish the latest changes.

## Handle approvals or rejections

Follow these steps to retrieve the pending requests, build an interface for user interaction, and resolve requests based on user's action:

1. In your app, create a workflow query (_getRefundReqs_) to fetch these requests. Configure it as follows:
    * **Workflow name** - Select **Refunds**.
    * **Request type** - Select **Get requests**.
    * **Request name** - Add `getPendingRefundRequests` to it. It's the same request name you added in your workflow _Main_ JS object in `appsmith.workflows.assignRequest()` in the step 1 of this section.
2. Drag a Table widget and bind the **getRefundReqs** query to it. You may need to transform data based on your user interface requirements. In which case, use a JS object to execute the query, perform transformations, and bind the transformed data to the Table widget.
3. Create another workflow query (_resolveReqs_) to capture **Approve** or **Reject** actions:
    * **Workflow name** - Select **Refunds**.
    * **Request type** - Select **Resolve Requests**.
    * **Request Id** - Add `{{this.params.requestId}}` to it.
    * **Resolution** - Add `{{this.params.resolution}}` to it.
    * **Metadata** - Add `{"rejectionReason" : {{this.params.rejectionReason}}}` to it.
4. Bind the query (_resolveReqs_) to the `onClick` event of **Approve** and **Reject** buttons, and pass appropriate parameters. 
5. Deploy your app to test approvals or rejections.
