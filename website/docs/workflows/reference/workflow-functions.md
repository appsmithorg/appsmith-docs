Workflow functions are in build framework functions that enables you to build human-in-the-loop integration. This page provides information about the workflow functions available in Appsmith, including their signatures, parameters, and usage examples.

## executeWorkflow()

The `executeWorkflow()` function serves as a central control unit for executing workflows within Appsmith. This function allows you to create a workflow logic for execution of tasks.

### Signature

```javascript
executeWorkflow(data: JSON): Promise<boolean>
```
### Parameters

Below are the parameters required by the `executeWorkflow()` function to execute:

#### data `JSON`

<dd>
  The parameter `data` holds the data passed from your App to trigger and process the workflow. For example, consider the following data passed to the workflow:

    ```javascript
      {
        "userId": 123,
        "action": "updateProfile",
        "data": {
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Doe",
          "email": "john.doe@example.com"
        }
      }

    ```
  In your workflow, you can access properties within the `data` object like `userId` using dot notation. To access the `userId`, use `data.userId`.
</dd>

### Return type `Promise<boolean>`

The `executeWorkflow()` returns a Promise that resolves to a boolean value, either `true` or `false`, indicating the success or failure of the workflow execution.

## assignRequest()

The `assignRequest()` function creates a pending request that requires user intervention and can be accessed later in your apps to enable users to take action.

### Signature

```javascript
assignRequest({requestName: string, message: string, resolutions: string[], metadata:{key: string, value: any}, requestToUsers: string[], requestToGroups: string[] }) : Promise<JSON>
```

### Parameters
 
Below are the parameters required by the `assignRequest()` function to execute:

#### requestName `String`

    <dd>
    The name of the request, which serves as its identifier within the workflow. This name can be used to filter requests as part of [Get requests](/workflows/reference/workflow-queries#get-requests) workflow query by adding it in the `Request name` attribute.
    </dd>

#### message `String` `Optional`
    <dd>
      A descriptive message associated with the request, providing additional context for users. For example, when creating a refund request, you might include a message like "Refund request raised by User 1".
    </dd>

#### resolutions `String[]`
    <dd>
    Represents the possible actions a user can take on the request. The resolution is passed to the [Resolve requests](/workflows/reference/workflow-queries#resolve-requests) workflow query to apply the selected resolution. For example, `['Approve', 'Reject']`.
    </dd>

#### metadata `JSON` `Optional `
    <dd>
    Add data that may be needed to process the request or display more information to the user in your app. For example, you can include a unique identifier for the record associated with the request. Use the identifier in your app to fetch and show the details to user.
    </dd>

#### requestToUsers  
   <dd>
   Specifies the user or users to whom the request will be assigned for resolution. Each element in the array has to be the email that you use for logging into your Appsmith app. It's mandatory to supply this attribute if you are not supplying `requestToGroups` atribute.
   </dd>

#### requestToGroups `String[]` `Optional`

<dd>
Specifies the group name or names to which the request will be assigned for resolution. When specified, the request will be assigned to all the users belonging to the groups. Each group name must be configured in your app and have appropriate permissions to perform actions. It's mandatory to supply this attribute if you are not supplying the `requestToUsers` attribute.
 </dd>

### Return type `Promise<JSON>`

The `assignRequest()` function returns a Promise in a JSON format representing the generated response. The response includes the following data:

#### workflowInstanceId `String`

<dd>
  Represents the unique identifier for the workflow instance.
</dd>

#### resolution `String`

<dd>
  Indicates the resolution applied to the request based on the user action.
</dd>

#### payload `JSON`

<dd>
  Contains the data supplied in the `metadata` attribute while processing the [Resolve Requests](/workflows/reference/workflow-queries#resolve-requests) workflow query to apply the resolution to the request based on user action.
</dd>
