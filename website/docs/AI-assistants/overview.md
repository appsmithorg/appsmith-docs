Appsmith AI Assistants allow you to build custom AI-driven assistants that integrate with your internal tools, databases, and APIs. These assistants help automate tasks, streamline workflows, and enhance efficiency with minimal coding required.


- **Citations:** AI responses are supported by citations derived from connected data sources. These citations provide verifiable references for the information used in AI-generated answers, ensuring data accuracy and transparency.

- **Custom Workflows:** Appsmith allows you to design and customize workflows that interact with AI suggestions. You can design workflows that interact with AI suggestions using a drag-and-drop interface. Widgets can be added to workflows to allow users to interact with data, input values, and make decisions based on AI responses.

- **Embedding AI Assistants:** Appsmith AI Assistants can be embedded into various applications with a chat interface that adjusts to different screen sizes. 

- **Identity & Access:** Integrate with existing Single Sign-On (SSO) and SCIM providers to manage user access. Role-based permissions allow you to control access to data and organize teams into secure, isolated workspaces.

- **LLM Integration:** You can choose from various large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. Appsmith provides full control over API keys and model configurations, allowing you to tailor the AI assistant to your specific needs.
