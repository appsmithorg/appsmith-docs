## Content properties


These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the widget, allowing users to modify the widget according to their preferences.


### Data


#### Options `String`


<dd>


This property allows you to set the labels and values for the items. You can add these labels and values directly from the user interface or use JavaScript by providing options in JSON format, where each entry must follow the `label-value` format, like:

```js
[
 {
   "label": "Option1",
   "value": "OPTION1"
 },
 {
   "label": "Option2",
   "value": "OPTION2"
 }..
]
```
Ensure that the values assigned to each option are unique. Additionally, you can dynamically display data by using JavaScript. For instance, you can use the `.map()` function to transform the data to the desired format, like:


```js
{{getdata.data.map( p => ({label: p.country, value: p.country}))}}
```


</dd>


#### Default Selected Values `String`
<dd>
Allows you to set default options in a widget. These options are initially selected when the widget is loaded, representing the user's default input unless modified. Multiple default items can be added by providing them as an array of values. For example:


```js
[
 "OPTION1", "OPTION2"
]
```


</dd>

#### Orientation

<dd>

Allows you to set the layout direction of the checkboxes in the Checkbox Group. You can choose between:

- **Horizontal**: Displays the checkboxes side by side in a single row.
- **Vertical**: Stacks the checkboxes in a column.

</dd>


### Label

The Label property is a group of customizable settings that define the main text displayed on the widget. 


#### Text `String`


<dd>

Defines the label for the entire Checkbox Group widget. This label serves as the heading or title, providing context for the group of checkboxes. 

</dd>

#### Tooltip `String`
<dd>

 Allows you to add a tooltip that appears when the user hovers over the Checkbox Group widget. This can be used to provide additional information or instructions about the entire set of checkboxes, helping users understand the purpose or expected input for the group. 

</dd>

### Validations


#### Required `Boolean`


<dd>
This validation feature allows you to designate the Checkbox Group as a mandatory field. For instance, when the Checkbox is placed within a Form widget, enabling the Required property ensures that the Form's submit button remains disabled until the Checkbox Group is checked.




</dd>


### General

General properties are essential configurations that provide overall control over the widget's behavior and appearance. 






#### Visible `boolean`

<dd>

This property controls the visibility of the widget. If you turn off this property, the widget would not be visible in view mode. Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on `JS` next to the **Visible** property to conditionally control the widget's visibility. 

For example, if you want to make the widget visible only when the user selects "Yes" from a Select widget, you can use the following JavaScript expression: 
```js
{{Select1.selectedOptionValue === "Yes"}}
```


</dd>


#### Disabled `boolean`

<dd>

This property prevents users from selecting the Checkbox widget. Even though the widget remains visible, user input is not permitted. Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on `JS` next to the **Disabled** property to control the widget's disable state conditionally. 


For example, if you want to allow only a specific user to interact with the Audio Recorder widget, you can use the following JavaScript expression in the disabled property:

```JS
{{appsmith.user.email=="john@appsmith.com"?false:true}}
```


</dd>

#### Animate Loading `boolean`

<dd>

This property controls whether the widget is displayed with a loading animation. When enabled, the widget shows a skeletal animation during the loading process. Additionally, you can control it through JavaScript by clicking on the <code>JS</code> next to the property.

</dd>




### Events

Events are properties that allow you to define actions or responses based on user interactions or widget state changes.


#### onCheckChange

<dd>

This event defines the action that would be executed when the user selects or deselects multiple or single items in the checkbox group. It allows you to specify a list of [supported actions](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions) that can be triggered in response to the checkbox state change.

</dd>



## Reference properties
These properties are not available in the property pane, but can be accessed using the dot operator in other widgets or JavaScript functions. For instance, to get the visibility status, you can use `CheckboxGroup1.isVisible`.



#### options `Array`

<dd>

The `options` property is an array that contains the values of all the available options.

</dd>

#### selectedValues `Array`

<dd>

The `selectedValues` property holds an array of values that represents the options selected by the user.

</dd>

#### isValid `Boolean`

<dd>

The valid property indicates the validation status of a widget, providing information on whether the widget's current value is considered valid or not.

</dd>

#### isDisabled `Boolean`

<dd>

The `isDisabled` property indicates the disabled status of a widget. It is represented by a boolean value, where `true` indicates that the widget is not available, and `false` indicates that it is enabled for user interaction.

</dd>

#### isVisible `Boolean`
<dd>

The `isVisible` property indicates the visibility state of a widget, with `true` indicating it is visible and `false` indicating it is hidden.

</dd>

## Methods

Widget property setters enable you to modify the values of widget properties at runtime, eliminating the need to manually update properties in the editor.

These methods are asynchronous and return a [Promise](/core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-promises#using-promises-in-appsmith). You can use the `.then()` block to ensure execution and sequencing of subsequent lines of code in Appsmith.


#### setVisibility (param: boolean): Promise

<dd>

This allows you to change the visibility of widget based on conditions or user interactions within JS.

*Example*:

```js
CheckboxGroup1.setVisibility(true)
```

</dd>


#### setDisabled (param: boolean): Promise

<dd>

Sets the disabled state of the widget.

*Example*:

```js
CheckboxGroup1.setDisabled(false)
```


</dd>

#### setValue (param: object): Promise

<dd>

Allows you to dynamically set the selected values of the Checkbox Group widget. This method is useful for updating the user's selections programmatically based on specific conditions or data from other widgets or queries.

*Example*: If you want to preselect an option based on a userâ€™s role:


```js
CheckboxGroup1.setValue([{ label: 'Admin', value: 'admin' }, { label: 'Editor', value: 'editor' }])
```

</dd>


#### setRequired (param: boolean): Promise

<dd>

Sets whether the widget is required or not.

*Example*:

```js
CheckboxGroup1.setRequired(true)
```


</dd>
