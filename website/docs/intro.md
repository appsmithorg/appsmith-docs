# Introduction

## What is Appsmith?

[Appsmith](https://www.appsmith.com) is a low code, open-source developer tool to build internal applications quickly.

You can drag and drop pre-built widgets to build UI on a grid-style canvas. Appsmith simplifies frontend and backend integration between the UI and the datasource to optimize building applications. Appsmith supports JavaScript inside widgets, queries, and almost any other component to add logic, transform data, and define complex workflows.

Build **CRUD** apps, **Dashboards**, **Admin Panels**, **Dynamic Forms**, and much more **10x faster**.

## How Appsmith Works

* **Connect Datasource**: Integrate with a datasource such as a database or an API. Appsmith has plug-and-play support for many databases and the RESTful API interface to connect with most tools seamlessly.
* **Build UI**: Use customizable built-in widgets to build an app layout quickly.
* **Access Data**: Connect UI to the datasource by writing queries and binding the data to widgets. Control everything with JavaScript.
* **Collaborate, Deploy, Share**: Appsmith also supports version control with Git to track changes, create rollbacks and collaborate using git branches. Deploy the app and share it with other users.

You can build anything from simple CRUD apps to complicated multi-step workflows with these simple steps. Appsmith makes it easy to build a UI that talks to any datasource.
