# Asynchronous JavaScript Function Settings

The asynchronous function allows you to choose when you want to execute code. For example, you may want to delay the query execution or fetch the data on demand.

## How to define an Asynchronous function in Appsmith?

In the Appsmith environment, a function is termed as **async** if you are performing one of the below actions:

*   You have a keyword (async) that marks the asynchronous execution of the function.

    ```
    export default{
    	functionName: async() => {
    	   //use async-await or promises
    	}
    }
    ```
* You have any in-built Appsmith functions like `showModal(), showAlert()`, etc., added in the function block.
*   You want to execute a query or call an API on run time. For example, you have an API `GetUsersList,` and you want to call this API on runtime, that is, whenever the JS Object function `callAPI()` is executed. Your function may look as below:

    ```
    export default {
       callAPI: () => {
          GetUsersList.run();
       }
     }
    ```

The line of code `GetUsersList.run()` marks the function `callAPI()` for asynchronous execution and hence `callAPI` function is considered as async.

A JavaScript Editor in Appsmith provides some additional settings for asynchronous functions that helps you add more configurations.

You can specify the settings in the **Settings** tab on the Appsmith JS Editor.

## Settings

You’ll see the **Settings** tab next to **Code** whenever you have added an **asynchronous function** to the JS Object. Head to the **Settings** tab and click it to reveal additional configurations.

Let’s quickly dive into these configurations to understand how they help you make your application behavior better.

Navigate to **JS Object** —> You’ll see **Settings** next to **Code**

![How to navigate to JS Object Settings for an asynchronous function?](/img/JSObject-Settings-Tab.png)

Click **Settings** to reveal configurations.

![Configurations available for asynchronous functions](/img/Settings-Configurations.png)

You get two settings to configure for asynchronous functions:

* RUN ON PAGE LOAD
* CONFIRM BEFORE CALLING

The settings are available at the function level. For **every** asynchronous function defined, you’ll have a corresponding configuration available for a run on page load and confirm before calling. Refer to the screenshot below, where you can see that the functions - **myFun2** and **`showData`** have configurations available that you can define for them individually.

![The asynchronous function configurations are available for each async function defined in a JS Object.](/img/Async-Setting-Function-Level.png)

### RUN ON PAGE LOAD

As the name suggests, you can use the configuration to mark that your function is executed whenever a page is loaded. For example, you have a page `User Listing` and have added a JS object with the function `GetUserRole` which fetches the user’s role. You want that the query should be executed at the time of page load so that the logged-in user is able to see the user listing. To get this working, you have to set the **RUN ON PAGE LOAD** configuration as **YES** for the `GetUserRole` function. Once the configuration is in place, the function `GetUserRole` is executed whenever the app is loaded and the response generated by it is displayed on the page.

:::info
By default, **RUN ON PAGE LOAD** is turned **ON** (**Yes** selected) for functions that display data on a widget. That is, the widget binds to the response generated by **`JSObjectName.asynFunctionName.data`**. In this case, the on-page load is automatically set as true. You can explicitly change this setting to suit your logic in the **Settings** tab.
:::

If you wish to delay the call of function on demand, then select **No**. It marks that the function isn't called on page load, and the execution is deferred until called on demand by calling the function.

#### Configure run on page load

On Appsmith, you can bind execution of JS Objects on page load in either of two ways:

**Bind Response to Widget**

Whenever you bind a [query](../../data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/) or [API](../../connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/) response to a [widget](../../../reference/widgets/), Appsmith automatically sets the execution of the corresponding API or Query on page load. For example, you have a widget that refers to the data property of the JavaScript async function by adding `{{JSObject.myFun.data}}`, at that time Appsmith marks the execution of that query/API on page load. You can modify the same by navigating to **JSObject** → **Settings** → **RUN ON PAGE LOAD** → Select **No**.

Here’s a quick snapshot of how Appsmith triggers a query or API execution on page load:

* Add a [table](../../../reference/widgets/table/) widget (_Table1_), and add a function in `JSObject5` that calls an API _`getUsers`_. The _`getUsers`_ API call is embedded in the _`showData`_ function and generates a user listing.

![Call a getUsers API in the `showData` JS function](</img/Bind-Response-to-widget_(1).png>)

* Bind the response generated by `showData` to table widget `Table1` by adding the below code in the `Table Data` property available on the property pane of the [Table](../../../reference/widgets/table/#table-data) widget.

```
{{JSObject5.showData.data}} // behind the scenes Appsmith 
                           // marks execution of showData on page load 				        
                          // to get the response and bind it to the table data 
```

![`showData` function called on page load](/img/Show-Data-Called-OnPageLoad.png)

**Asynchronous Function Setting**

Especially for [asynchronous functions](asynchronous-javascript-function-settings.md#how-to-define-asynchronous-function-in-appsmith), you can explicitly mark the execution of an async function on page load for the corresponding JS Object.

Navigate to **JS Object** —> Click **Settings** —> Select **Yes** for **RUN ON PAGE LOAD** next to the JS function. You are all set. Appsmith takes care of executing the async function on page load for you.

![How to set run on page load for async function?](</img/Async_Function_Setting_-_On_Page_Load.png>)

As shown in the screenshot below, you can see that the `showData` function is called **on page load**, and `Table1` displays the data.

![Data displayed in the table widget](/img/Show-Data-Data-Displayed-InTable.png)

### CONFIRM BEFORE CALLING

With this setting, you can generate a confirmation pop-up and take the user’s input for executing the function. For example, the JS object has the function `deletePermission` which calls an API that deletes the database’s permission. You would want to ensure that the user wants to delete permission, in which case, you would like to show a confirmation dialog. The confirmation dialog ensures that the user wants to perform a delete action. A user can choose **Yes** to delete or can decline the same by choosing **No**. Thus, `Confirm Before Calling` comes in handy to protect against users accidentally running destructive operations.

![A confirmation dialog is shown to the user before execution on myFun2](</img/Confirmation_Dialog.png>)

#### Configure confirm before calling

Confirmation is like a nudge given to the user before executing a function. It ensures that the user is aware of the action that would be performed, and the same is not triggered by chance. A confirmation setting can only be defined explicitly from the Settings tab.

Navigate to **JS Object** —> Click **Settings** —> Select **Yes** for **CONFIRM BEFORE CALLING** next to the JS function. You are all set. Appsmith takes care of executing and showing the confirmation dialog to the user whenever the action is triggered.

## When to use Asynchronous settings

Asynchronous function settings enable users to create complex workflows by executing functions before the application loads, allowing the data manipulation logic to run and make the desired outcome— secure function execution with a confirmation before you want application users to execute any critical operations.

Let’s understand the settings deeper with examples.

For example, you would want to apply restrictions in your application based on the user’s domain. That is, anonymous users (users who are not a part of your domain) cannot access certain application pages. You can quickly implement this by creating a function that uses the asynchronous function setting- Run on page load.

 <VideoEmbed host="youtube" videoId="6wCD_fgd8TQ" /> 


Here’s a quick snapshot of steps that you can take to create this logic:

* Create an application and add two pages.
  * First Page (UserListingForAppsmithUsers)- Add a table, and rename it to `UserListing` which displays the data generated by the `showUserListing` function of the `DataLoader` JS object. The function generates a list of users.
  * Second Page (AnonymousUser) - Displays a message to the user.
* Create a JS object `DataLoader` and add a function `showUserListing` _that checks whether the user is logged in or not_.\_ The function verifies the below logic:
  * If the user is logged in, then the `GetUserList` API is called, and the response is generated
  * If the user is not logged in or is not an Appsmith user, redirect the user to the `AnonymousUser` page.
* Mark function `showUserListing` of JS Object - DataLoader to run on page load by selecting **Yes**.

**UserListingForAppsmithUsers** - DataLoader JS object Code. You can see that a function `showUserListing` is marked for asynchronous execution by defining the `async` keyword.

```
export default {
	showUserListing: async () => {
		//use async-await or promises
		if(appsmith.user.isAnonymous) {
	       	  navigateTo("AnonymousUser");
		}
		//verify if the logged-in user is from appsmith
		if(appsmith.user.email.match("appsmith")){
		  return GetUserList.run();
		}else{
		  navigateTo("AnonymousUser");
		}		
	}
}
```

For logged-in appsmith users, a user listing is shown as the`GetUserList` API is executed:

![The user listing is displayed to logged-in appsmith users](/img/LoggedIn-Appsmith-Users-User-Listing-Shown.png)

**Anonymous users -** Whenever the application renders, the `showUserListing` function is executed. The function determines whether the user is anonymous. You can use the property of a user object `isAnonymous` to check the user's logged-in status.

```
appsmith.user.isAnonymous
```

![An anonymous user is shown the page with an unauthorized message](/img/Anonymous-Users.png)

Suppose the user is **not** logged in, then `appsmith.user.isAnonymous` _returns `true`  **and redirects** the user to the `AnonymousUser` page and displays the message._

:::info
You are not authorized to view user data.
:::

If the user is **logged in** `appsmith.user.isAnonymous` returns `false` and the logic is executed to verify if the logged-in user is an Appsmith user. If the user is an Appsmith user, `GetUserList` API is called to fetch the user listing. The execution is completed, and the response is generated, displayed in the `UserListing` table.
