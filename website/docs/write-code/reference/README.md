# Reference

The Appsmith framework simplifies the creation of dynamic, data-driven applications that respond to user interactions in real-time. It consists of built-in global objects and framework functions, that enhance the development process and enable seamless user experiences. Global objects like Appsmith object, Console object, and Query object enable users to execute database queries, share data between pages using parameters, gather information about the application's current state, and facilitate code debugging. Framework functions serve as valuable tools for developers to enhance user experience and effectively interact with the application.
