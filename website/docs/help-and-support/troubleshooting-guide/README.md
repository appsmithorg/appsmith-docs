# Overview

When using Appsmith, you may encounter errors related to both self-hosting the platform and building applications. This page provides detailed resources to help you troubleshoot and resolve common issues. To troubleshoot your issue, you can try the following:


### Check Your Appsmith Version

You can check your Appsmith version to ensure compatibility with the latest features and fixes. This helps identify if an update is needed to resolve any potential issues. Use the following command to check your Appsmith version:

- For Docker: 

<dd>

```bash
docker exec -it appsmith cat info.json
```

</dd>

- For Kubernetes: 

<dd>

```bash
kubectl exec -it <appsmith-pod-name> -- cat /appsmith-stacks/configuration/info.json
```
</dd>

Once you've confirmed your version, visit the [Appsmith GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/releases) to compare your current version with the latest release. If your version is outdated, consider upgrading to the latest version to benefit from the latest fixes and features.

For instructions on how to upgrade, please refer to our [upgrade guides](/getting-started/setup/instance-management).


### Verify Logs for Errors

Logs provide key information about your Appsmith instance and help identify any issues during deployment or operation. Run the following command to check the logs:

- For Docker: You can view logs using the following command:

<dd>

```bash
docker logs appsmith
```
</dd>

- For Kubernetes: Use the following command to view logs for the Appsmith pod:

<dd>
