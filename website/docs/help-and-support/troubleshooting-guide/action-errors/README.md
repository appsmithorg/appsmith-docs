### Timeout error

#### Error message

<Message
 messageContainerClassName="error"
messageContent="Timed out on query execution"></Message>


#### Cause

If your API / DB Query times out, it could be due to one of the following reasons

* Your API / Database is behind a VPC which is not accessible from the appsmith Instance. This can be fixed by whitelisting the appsmith instance in your database or VPC.
* Your API / Query is taking too long to respond. This can be fixed by fetching smaller datasets using

#### Solution

You could resolve the error response by doing one of the following:

- [Server-side pagination](/build-apps/how-to-guides/Server-side-pagination-in-table): Allows you to manage and display large datasets within your application. It involves fetching and displaying only a portion of data from the server at a time, enhancing performance.

- [Timeout Configuration](/connect-data/reference/query-settings): The Appsmith server has a default internal timeout of 60 seconds. If your queries take longer than this, you can set a value greater than 60 seconds. For self-hosted instances, you can set the `APPSMITH_SERVER_TIMEOUT` environment variable to a value greater than 60 seconds. For example, if you want a timeout of 80 seconds, use- `APPSMITH_SERVER_TIMEOUT=80`.



### Configuration error

```
getUsers failed to execute. Please check its configuration
```

This message indicates an error in the configuration of the action. You can navigate to the API / Query in this state and see the error it encountered. If the error occurred intermittently, it is likely due to a value in the configuration not being available at the time that the API / Query was run.

This message indicates that the query was expecting a [base64 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) value as content body, but the actual value passed to it was not base64 encoded.

This error can be fixed by passing a base64 encoded value as a file content parameter in the query.

```

This message indicates that the query parameter mentioned in the message expects a number but a non-numerical value has been provided in the query form.
