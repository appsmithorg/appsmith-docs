```
Application name can't be empty
```

This error indicates that the application name field has been left empty.

This error can be fixed by editing the application name field and providing a non-empty string as the application name.

## Duplicate Name Error

```
Entity name: <name> is already being used
```

This error indicates that the name being assigned to the entity has been used before.

[JavaScript reserved keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js\_reserved.asp) and [the window object methods and properties](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj\_window.asp) cannot be used as entity names. You can fix the error by assigning a new unique name to the entity.
