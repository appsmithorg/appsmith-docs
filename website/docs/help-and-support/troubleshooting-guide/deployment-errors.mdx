# Troubleshooting Deployment Errors

Deploying Appsmith is typically a smooth process, but sometimes you may encounter errors that prevent you from successfully setting up your instance. This guide walks through common deployment-related errors and provides strategies for troubleshooting them.

## Pre-deployment checklist

Before delving into specific errors, it's essential to ensure that the pre-deployment conditions are met:

- Confirm that the target server meets the [minimum hardware requirements](/getting-started/setup).
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to install and configure Appsmith on the server.
- Ensure that all required ports (for example, 80 and 443 for web traffic) are open and not blocked by a firewall.

## Service start-up issues

After installation, Appsmith services might fail to start due to configuration problems or port conflicts.

### Port conflicts

- **Examine Service Logs:** You can typically find logs in `/opt/appsmith` or by using Docker commands like `docker logs appsmith`.
- **Check Port Availability:** Use `netstat` or similar tools to ensure the ports Appsmith needs are not already in use.
- **Ensure Proper Configuration:** If you've modified any configuration files or environment variables, verify their correctness.

If you encounter the error that `ports 80 & 443` aren't open, it's recommended that you stop all processes on these ports and start again. If the processes on these ports cannot be stopped, you can run appsmith on another port by editing the docker-compose.yml file and restarting the instance.

### Configuration problems

You can typically find logs in `/opt/appsmith` or by using Docker commands like `docker logs appsmith`. For more information about where to find logs, see [Get Container Logs](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/how-to-get-container-logs#docker).

    If you encourter the below error:

    <Message
    messageContainerClassName="error"
    messageContent="`org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'mongockInitializingBeanRunner' defined in class path resource [com/appsmith/server/configurations/MongoConfig.class]: Error in method[Migration020TransferToDatasourceStorage.executeMigration] : Unable to invoke Cipher due to bad padding`"
    ></Message>

    To resolve the error, you may choose one of the below options:

    * If you want to overwrite the previous Appsmith installation, delete the `/stacks` folder from the installation directory, and re-run the Docker command.
    * If you want to keep the previous Appsmith installation, create a new installation directory and follow the [installation](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/docker#install-appsmith) instructions.

## SSL/TLS certification errors

When opting for an automatic SSL setup with Let's Encrypt, you may encounter certification errors.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Domain Configuration:** Ensure that the domain name is properly configured and pointing to the server's IP address.
- **Let's Encrypt Rate Limiting:** Be aware that Let's Encrypt has rate limits. If you've hit the limit, you may need to wait before trying again.
- **Check Logs:** SSL-related errors will be logged in Let's Encrypt logs. Check these for specific Error messages.


## Database connection failures

Appsmith requires a connection to its internal database. If it fails to connect, the deployment will not be successful.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Review Database Logs:** Look for any errors in the database service logs that might indicate connection issues.
- **Environment Variables:** Verify the environment variables related to the database configuration are set correctly, such as `APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI`.
- **Network Accessibility:** Make sure the database is reachable from the Appsmith server if you're using an external database.


## Environment-specific problems

Deployment errors can also be specific to the environment in which Appsmith is being installed, such as specific cloud providers or operating systems.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Provider Documentation:** Consult the documentation of the specific environment for any quirks or additional steps required for a successful deployment.
- **Security Groups/Firewalls:** Check any security groups or firewall rules to ensure they aren't blocking the necessary traffic for Appsmith.

# Troubleshooting Deployment Errors

Deploying Appsmith is typically a smooth process, but sometimes you may encounter errors that prevent you from successfully setting up your instance. This guide walks through common deployment-related errors and provides strategies for troubleshooting them.

- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to install and configure Appsmith on the server.
- Ensure that all required ports (for example, 80 and 443 for web traffic) are open and not blocked by a firewall.

## Port conflicts

After installation, Appsmith services might fail to start due to port not being available.

### Error message

<Message
  messageContainerClassName="error"
  messageContent="Ports `80` and `443` aren't open."
></Message>

### Cause

The error occurs when the required ports `80` and `443` are not available for Appsmith to use due to other processes using them.

### Solution

To address this issue, you have the following options:

- Stop all processes on ports `80` and `443` and start again. This ensures that the processes using the ports may free the ports and Appsmith can use it. This only helps if there were processes which were using ports but are no longer running on those ports.
- If stopping processes on these ports is not viable, or there are other processes which continue to run on these ports then edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to assign different ports to Appsmith and restart the instance.

## Configuration problems

After installation, Appsmith services might fail to start due to some configuration problems.

### Error message

If you encounter the below error:

<Message
  messageContainerClassName="error"
  messageContent="`org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'mongockInitializingBeanRunner' defined in class path resource [com/appsmith/server/configurations/MongoConfig.class]: Error in method[Migration020TransferToDatasourceStorage.executeMigration] : Unable to invoke Cipher due to bad padding`"
></Message>

### Cause

The error occurs due to MongoDB hosting Appsmith data. That is the machine you are trying to install Appsmith on already has an Appsmith installation and MongoDB is hosting that data. The newly installed Appsmith data cannot be overridden as the existing data is encrypted using the encryption password (`APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`)and encryption salt (`APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT`).

### Solution

To resolve the error, you may choose one of the below options:

- If you want to overwrite the previous Appsmith installation, delete the `/stacks` folder from the installation directory, and re-run the Docker command.
- If you want to keep the previous Appsmith installation, create a new installation directory and follow the [installation](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/docker#install-appsmith) instructions.

## SSL/TLS certification errors

### Error message

When opting for an automatic SSL setup with Let's Encrypt, you may encounter certification errors.

### Cause

SSL/TLS certification errors occur due to issues with domain configuration, Let's Encrypt rate limiting, or specific error messages in the Let's Encrypt logs.

### Solution

Follow the below steps to troubleshoot the error:

- Ensure that the domain name is properly configured and pointing to the server's IP address.
- Be aware of Let's Encrypt rate limits and wait if you've hit the limit before trying again.
- Check Let's Encrypt logs for specific Error messages related to SSL/TLS certification.

## Database connection failures

### Error message

Appsmith requires a connection to its internal database. If it fails to connect, the deployment will not be successful.

### Cause

Database connection failures can occur due to issues with database service logs, incorrect environment variables related to database configuration, or network accessibility problems.
