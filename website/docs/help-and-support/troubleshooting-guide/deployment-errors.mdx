# Deployment Errors

Deploying Appsmith is typically a smooth process, but sometimes you may encounter errors that prevent you from successfully setting up your instance. This guide walks through common deployment-related errors and provides strategies for troubleshooting them.

## Pre-Deployment checklist

Before we delve into specific errors, it is essential to ensure that the pre-deployment conditions are met:

- Confirm that the target server meets the [minimum hardware requirements](/getting-started/setup).
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to install and configure Appsmith on the server.
- Ensure that all required ports (for example, 80 and 443 for web traffic) are open and not blocked by a firewall.

## Common deployment errors

### 1\. Service Start-up Issues

After installation, Appsmith services might fail to start due to configuration problems or port conflicts.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Examine Service Logs:** You can typically find logs in `/opt/appsmith` or by using Docker commands like `docker logs appsmith`.
- **Check Port Availability:** Use `netstat` or similar tools to ensure the ports Appsmith needs are not already in use.
- **Ensure Proper Configuration:** If you've modified any configuration files or environment variables, verify their correctness.

If you encounter the error that `ports 80 & 443` aren't open, its is recommended that you stop all processes on these ports and start again. If the processes on these ports cannot be stopped, you can run appsmith on another port by editing the docker-compose.yml file and restarting the instance.

### 2\. SSL/TLS Certification Errors

When opting for an automatic SSL setup with Let's Encrypt, you may encounter certification errors.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Domain Configuration:** Ensure that the domain name is properly configured and pointing to the server's IP address.
- **Let's Encrypt Rate Limiting:** Be aware that Let's Encrypt has rate limits. If you've hit the limit, you may need to wait before trying again.
- **Check Logs:** SSL-related errors will be logged in Let's Encrypt logs. Check these for specific error messages.

### 4\. Database Connection Failures

Appsmith requires a connection to its internal database. If it fails to connect, the deployment will not be successful.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Review Database Logs:** Look for any errors in the database service logs that might indicate connection issues.
- **Environment Variables:** Verify the environment variables related to the database configuration are set correctly, such as `APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI`.
- **Network Accessibility:** Make sure the database is reachable from the Appsmith server if you're using an external database.

### 5\. Environment-Specific Problems

Deployment errors can also be specific to the environment in which Appsmith is being installed, such as specific cloud providers or operating systems.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Provider Documentation:** Consult the documentation of the specific environment for any quirks or additional steps required for a successful deployment.
- **Security Groups/Firewalls:** Check any security groups or firewall rules to ensure they aren't blocking the necessary traffic for Appsmith.
