# Deployment Errors

## Ports unavailable

If you encounter the error that ```ports 80 & 443``` aren't open, its is recommended that you stop all processes on these ports and start again. If the processes on these ports cannot be stopped, you can run appsmith on another port.

1.  In the file `docker-compose.yml`, change the ports for the [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) container to a custom port as shown in the below example.

    ```
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "443:443"
          - "9001:9001"
    ```

    Change to

    ```
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
          - "8443:443"
          - "9801:9001"
    ```
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`

:::tip
To stop a previous version of appsmith running on these ports, run the following:

* ```sudo su```
* ```docker container kill $(docker ps -q)```
:::

## Containers Failed to Start

If you chose to initialize a new database and are seeing this error, it could be due to an error while fetching dependencies during installation. Deleting the current installation direction, killing the docker containers, and restarting the installation should work. If it doesn't, please reach out on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp)

If you are trying to connect to an existing [MongoDB](../../reference/datasources/querying-mongodb/) and the containers failed to start it may be due to one of the following reasons:

1. Incorrect [MongoDB](../../reference/datasources/querying-mongodb/) credentials
2. Empty Salt / Password for encryption

Restart the installation process with valid values.

## Unable to access Appsmith

* Ensure your security groups are configured to allow traffic to ports 80 & 443 on your installation instance.
* You can access the running application on[ localhost](http://localhost) in any browser or the `public IP` of your machine.
* You may need to wait for a few minutes before accessing the application to allow [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) to start.

## OAuth sign up not working

If your deployment is behind an ELB / Proxy, you must update the [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) configuration of the deployment. In the file `data/nginx/nginx.app.conf.template` modify the line:

```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
```

with

```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $http_x_forwarded_proto;
```

This ensures that the redirect URLs are correct during [OAuth2](/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/authentication-type/oauth2-authentication/) logins. This works even if the ELB is configured to run on a custom port.

## Server not booting because of MongoCommandException

In release `v1.6.4`, Appsmith upgraded its libraries & [Spring framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework). This caused a compatibility issue between the libraries used within Appsmith and the version of [MongoDB](/reference/datasources/querying-mongodb/) that was shipped earlier. This didn't show up in testing because all testing happened against [MongoDB](/reference/datasources/querying-mongodb/) clusters with replica sets, where the problem doesn't surface.


If you see an error like the below, your instance is affected by the library upgrade performed in `v1.6.4`.

```
Caused by: com.mongodb.MongoCommandException: Command failed with error 17 (ProtocolError): 'Attempt to switch database target during SASL authentication.' on server mongo:27017. The full response is {"ok": 0.0, "errmsg": "Attempt to switch database target during SASL authentication.", "code": 17, "codeName": "ProtocolError"}
```

Please follow the steps mentioned below to fix your Appsmith installation.

#### Step 1: Edit MongoDB URI

Adding `&authSource=admin` to the end of your `APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI` variable’s value in your `docker.env` file. For example, in your `docker.env` file, if you have the following line:

```bash
# Old config
APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://<your_username>:<your_password>@mongo/appsmith?retryWrites=true
```

Change it to the following (notice the only change is `&authSource=admin`. Please don't paste this whole line. Only add the `&authSource=admin` part to your current value.

```bash
# New config
APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://<your_username>:<your_password>@mongo/appsmith?retryWrites=true&authSource=admin
```

Save the file.

#### Step 2: Restart server

Now restart your container with the following command:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d --force-recreate appsmith-internal-server
```

In a minute or two, the server should now come up and be ready.


## Unable to send emails

If you are having trouble with invitation emails not being sent, even though the **Admin email setup** is able to send test emails, it may be due to an issue with the configuration of the email parameters.

If you aren't receiving the invitation email, please check the value for ```APPSMITH_REPLY_TO``` in the configuration file. If this value is empty, please set it to the same email address that you are using for ```APPSMITH_MAIL_FROM``` and **restart the application**.

This should resolve the issue of not receiving the invitation email. Additionally, it may be helpful to verify that the email server being used is working correctly and there are no issues with the network or other components preventing the emails from being sent.

However, if you encounter any issues, you can contact the support team on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp) or ask questions on the [community forum](https://community.appsmith.com).

## Server shuts down with schema mismatch error

The instance keeps restarting due to a server shutdown displaying a schema mismatch error.

#### Error message

<Message
messageContainerClassName="error" 
messageContent="Looks like you skipped some required updates, please go back to the mandatory upgrade path v1.9.2"></Message>

#### Cause
As the error message in the server logs suggests, your Appsmith instance has missed a required checkpoint upgrade. This occurs if you are manually upgrading and have skipped a version or are on an automatic upgrade but your instance hasn't checked for updates for a particular period.

#### Solution

To resolve this error, you may need to manually map your instance to the required version, in this case, ```v1.9.2```. To do this, access your Appsmith instance and make the following change to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>
  
    From:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
    container_name: appsmith
```

To:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce:v1.9.2
    container_name: appsmith
```


</TabItem>
   <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">
   
From:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
    container_name: appsmith
```

To:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
    container_name: appsmith
```
   
   
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Save this file, then run the following command on your shell to restart Appsmith.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

:::note
In this case, version `1.9.2` was used. If required, you can also use a specific older version.
:::

With this, your server starts with the older version that makes all the necessary schema changes to your Appsmith instance. Once this process has been completed successfully (you can verify this by logging in to your Appsmith instance), you can return to the original version of your `docker-compose.yml` file and resume normal operations.


<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>

  ```bash
  services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">

  ```
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Run the restart command once again: 

 ```
 docker-compose up -d
  ```
:::note 
If you haven't been using your Appsmith instance for a while, it could be possible that there might be multiple versions that show up in the error message. In such a case, perform the same steps for each version in order, starting from the oldest.
:::

To prevent similar issues in the future, consider [enabling auto updates](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/docker#enabling-appsmith-auto-updates) for your Appsmith instance. If you already had auto updates on and still encountered this issue, please contact the [Appsmith team](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp) to determine the cause of the deployment problem

## Docker auto update / watchtower error on arm64

 ```
docker-compose ps
        Name                      Command                  State                                       Ports                                 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
appsmith               /opt/appsmith/entrypoint.s ...   Up (healthy)   0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp,:::443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp,:::80->80/tcp
ubuntu_auto_update_1   /watchtower --schedule 0 0 ...   Restarting    
 ```
#### Error message

<Message
messageContainerClassName="error" 
messageContent="auto_update_1 | exec /watchtower: exec format error"></Message>

#### Cause
On an arm64 architecture, watchtower may encounter errors when attempting to update the containers. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as compatibility issues with the specific version of the container image being used or issues with the configuration of the Docker environment. 

#### Solution
To resolve this issue, update the following line in the docker-compose file:

 ```
image: containrrr/watchtower:latest-dev
to:
image: containrrr/watchtower
 ```

After making the necessary changes, run the command ```docker-compose up -d``` again to start the containers. If you still encounter this issue, please contact the [Appsmith team](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp) to determine the cause of the deployment problem
