# Backup and Restore Errors

This guide helps you address common errors encountered while using `appsmithctl`, a command-line utility for backup and restore operations.

## Service 'appsmith' is not running container

When attempting to execute `appsmithctl` commands, you may face this error even if the appsmith service is up and running.

### Error Message

<Message
  messageContainerClassName="error"
  messageContent="Service 'appsmith' is not running container"
/>

### Cause

This error may occur even if the Appsmith service is running because the Appsmith container wasn't started with the `docker-compose` command, and Appsmith is not registered with Docker Compose which `appsmithctl` commands need.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Stop the current Appsmith container with: 

```bash 
docker stop appsmith
```
Wait for the container to fully stop before proceeding.

2. Go to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file using the `cd` command :

```bash 
cd /path/to/docker-compose/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/docker-compose/directory` with the actual path to the file.

3. Start Appsmith with Docker-Compose with the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the current directory. Instantiate the Appsmith container under with:

```bash 
docker-compose up -d
```
The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.

After completing these steps, Docker Compose will register the Appsmith container, resolving the error. The `appsmithctl` commands should now work as expected.
