Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- An Appsmith account. If you don’t have one, sign up on [**Appsmith cloud**](https://app.appsmith.com/).

## Set up

1. When you create a new account, Appsmith adds a workspace with an application titled **My first application** on the homepage by default. You need to create a new empty application for this tutorial. If you are inside an application and need to go to the homepage, click on the Appsmith logo at the top left of the screen to go to the homepage.

2. On the homepage, click the **+ New** button to the right of the screen under the default workspace. You'll land on a new application in the _Edit_ mode.

3. Click the **⌵** icon on the top left next to the default application name. Select the **Edit Name** option. Rename the app to `User Management`.

4. On the _Entity Explorer_ to the left of the screen, you'll see that **Page 1** is the default page on the application. Hover over the page name and click the **︙** icon.

5. Select the **Edit Name** option. Rename the page to `User Information`.
