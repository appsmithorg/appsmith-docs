# View Ticket Details

In this section, you'll learn to:
* Use the List widget to display tickets.
* Filter tickets in the List.
* Write JavaScript code using JS Objects.

Here's a screenshot of the final result:

## Fetch tickets data

1. On the *Entity Explorer* to the left of the screen, click on the **Tickets** page you created in the [Setting up the application](/getting-started/tutorials/customer-support-tool#setting-up-the-application) section.

2. On the **Explorer** tab, click the **+** icon next to **Queries/JS**. 

3. Select the **supportTickets query** from the list of options. 

4. Rename the query to `getTickets`. Click the white space near the query templates.

5. Write the following SQL query.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM support_ticket;
  ```

6. Click the **Run** button on the top right of the screen to execute the query and confirm that it returns data.

7. Click the **Settings** tab. Switch on the **Run query on page load** option.

## Build UI

1. Go back to the canvas by clicking on the **Tickets** page on the *Entity Explorer*.

2. Drop a Text widget and two Select widgets on the canvas.

3. To set the title using the Text widget:
    - Change the default value on the **Text** property from **Label** to `Tickets`.
    - Click the **Style** tab on the *Property Pane*. Select **XL** in the **Font size** property list.

4. Select the first Select widget, set the properties as shown below:
    - On the top of the property pane, change the name of the widget from **Select1** to `selStatus`.
    - In the **Options** property, add the below JSON array object to populate the status options.

    ```javascript
    [
      {
        "label": "Open",
        "value": "open"
      },
      {
        "label": "In Progress",
        "value": "in progress"
      },
      {
        "label": "Closed",
        "value": "closed"
      }
    ]
    ```
    - In the **Text** property, enter `Status`.
5. Similarly, for the second Select widget, set the properties as shown below: 
    - On the top of the property pane, change the name of the widget from **Select2** to `selPriority`.
    - In the **Options** property, add the below JSON array object to populate the priority options.

    ```javascript
    [
      {
        "label": "High",
        "value": "high"
      },
      {
        "label": "Medium",
        "value": "medium"
      },
      {
        "label": "Low",
        "value": "low"
      }
    ]
    ```
    - In the **Text** property, enter `Priority`.
  
  The output should look something like this:

## Display ticket details

1. Drop a List widget on the canvas below the Select widgets. 

2. On the top of the property pane, change the name from **List1** to `lstTicketDetails`.

3. Delete the default Text and Image widgets in the first list item. 

4. In the **Items** property, enter `{{getTickets.data}}` to connect the results of the query to the List widget.

5. Now customize the List widget as follows: 
    - Drop five Text widgets for displaying the ticket subject, requested date, customer email, ticket status and priority. 
    - Notice that all the changes you make in the first list item reflect in the subsequent list items that are greyed out. Refer to *Fig 3* for the placement of the widgets in the first list item. 

6. You now need to display the data from the query in these Text widgets. In step 2 above, you already connected the List widget to the **getTickets** query. Select each Text widget and use the `currentItem` reference property to display the data in the list items as shown in the table below: 

  | Property                     |Value                                              |
  | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | 
  | Text  | `Subject: {{currentItem.description}}` |
  | Text  | `Requested: {{moment(currentItem.created_at).format("LLL")}}`  |
  | Text  | `Email: {{currentItem.user}}` |
  | Text  | `{{currentItem.status}}` |
  | Text  | `{{currentItem.priority}}` |

7. Note that for the `created_at` database column, you are using the built-in library Moment.js to format the date and time. Use the resize handle of the Text widgets to fit the contents.

8. Let's add two Icon widgets next to the status and priority Text widgets and conditionally set the color. 

9. Select the Icon widget for *Status*. 

    - In the **Icon** property, search `time` and select the icon.
    - Click the **Style** tab.
      * In the **Button variant**, select the **Tertiary** option.
      * In the **Button Color** property, click the **JS** button and write code to show different colors for open and closed tickets as shown below:

```javascript
{{currentItem.status == 'open' ? appsmith.theme.colors.primaryColor : currentItem.status == 'closed'? '#16a34a': currentItem.status == 'in progress' ? '#eab308': undefined}}
```

10. Select the Icon widget for *Priority*. 

    - In the **Icon** property, search `trending-up` icon and select the icon.
    - Click the **Style** tab.
      * In the **Button variant**, select the **Tertiary** option.
      * In the **Button Color** property, click the **JS** button and write code to show different icon colors for tickets based on priority as shown below:
   
```javascript
{{currentItem.priority=='high' ? '#dc2626' : currentItem.priority=='medium' ? '#2563eb': currentItem.priority=='low' ? '#facc15' : undefined}}
```

Refer to Fig 3 for the output and placement of the widgets in the List.

## Filter tickets

Now, you have to program the Select widgets created in the [Build UI](#build-ui) section to filter the data in the List.

1. In the **Explorer** tab, click the **+** icon next to **Queries/JS**. 

2. Select **New JS Object** from the **Create new ** list.

3. Click the pencil icon next to the default name **JSObject1** and rename it to `utils`.

4. You have to write JS code to filter the tickets based on the values selected in the Select widgets. Delete the default code in the JS editor and paste the code snippet below:

  ```javascript
  export default {
    getFilteredTickets: async () => {
    const tickets = await getTickets.run();
    const status = selStatus.selectedOptionValue;
    const priority = selPriority.selectedOptionValue;

    let filteredTickets = tickets;

    if (status) {
      filteredTickets = tickets.filter(a => a.status === status);
    }
   
    if (priority) {
      filteredTickets = tickets.filter(a => a.priority === priority);
    }
   
    if (status && priority) {
      filteredTickets = tickets.filter(a => {
      return a.status === status && a.priority === priority;
      });
    }

    return filteredTickets;
    },  
  }
  ```
5. Click the **Run** button on the top right of the screen to ensure that the function executes successfully. 

6. Go back to the canvas by clicking on the **← Back** button above the JS editor.

7. To filter the list based on the value selected in the **Status** filter, you need to run the JS function every time the filter is changed. Click the **Status** Select widget. Set the properties as follows:
    - Scroll down to the **Events** section.
    - Click the **+** icon next to the **onOptionChange** event.
    - In the **Select an action** list, select **Execute a JS function > utils > getFilteredTickets**.

8. Repeat step 7 for the **Priority** filter.

9. Select the List widget. You need to update the **Items** property to display the data returned by the **utils** function now instead of the results directly from the **getTickets** query. Replace `getTickets.data` with the code below to fetch the filtered data from the function: 
  ```javascript
  {{utils.getFilteredTickets.data}}
  ```

10. Test the **Status** and **Priority** filters to see how the data in the List updates when options are changed.
