This tutorial guides you through the steps to create a Customer Support tool using Appsmith. The application contains a dashboard reporting the status of issues raised by customers. It also allows you to view, create, edit tickets and add comments. You'll learn to:
* Create a neat dashboard using the Chart and Stats Box widget.
* Use the List widget to display tickets.
* Use the Select widget to filter data in the List.
* Create and edit ticket details in a Modal.
* Write code using JS Objects.

Here's a view of the final result:

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

An Appsmith account. If you don’t have one, sign up on [**Appsmith Cloud**](https://app.appsmith.com/).

## Set up the application

1. On the homepage, click the **+ New** button to the right of the screen under the default workspace. You'll land on a new application in the *Edit* mode. 

2. Click the **⌵** icon on the top left next to the default application name. Select the **Edit Name** option. Rename the app to `Customer Support Tool`.

3. On the *Entity Explorer* to the left of the screen, you'll see that **Page 1** is the default page on the application. Hover over the page name and click the **︙** icon.  

4. Select the **Edit Name** option. Rename the page to `Dashboard`.

5. Create the **+** icon next to **Pages** on the *Entity Explorer* to create a second page named `Tickets`.
