# Work with Data in UI

In this lesson, you will learn how to display, update, and manage data. You will connect a table to a database, display user details in a form, and use the form to update user details directly from the UI.

:::tip What will I learn? üìù
By the end of this tutorial, you will learn to:

- Connect UI widgets to a database.
- Display and edit user details using a form.
- Update user details from the UI and save changes to the database.
- Trigger queries or JavaScript functions based on user actions.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have completed [Lesson 1: Connect and Display Data](/getting-started/tutorials/the-basics/connect-query-display-data), where you will learn how to connect your app to a database, fetch data, and display it using a Table widget.

1. Open your application and, from the Entity Explorer, click the **UI** tab. The UI tab opens a list of available widgets in Appsmith, which can be used to display data and design the app.

2. Click **+ New UI element** and drop a **Form** widget on the canvas to the right of the Table widget. The Form widget allows you to collect details from users, which can then be stored or used to update existing records in the database.

3. Rename the Form title to `User Details`. 

4. To display and edit user details, add an **Input** widget for the user's name, a **Datepicker** widget for the date of birth, and an **Image** widget for the profile photo inside the form.

<dd>

Configure the properties as shown below:


| **Widget**      | **Name**       | **Property**      | **Value**                          | **Description**                                       |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Input**     | `nameInput`    | Default Value   | `{{usersTable.selectedRow.name}}` | Displays the user's name and allows editing.  |
| **Datepicker** | `dobInput`    | Default Date    | `{{usersTable.selectedRow.dob}}`  | Displays the user's date of birth for selection and modification. |
|               |               | Date Format     | **LL**                           | Formats the date in a user-friendly format. |
| **Image**     | `profile` | Image Source  | `{{usersTable.selectedRow.image}}` | Displays the user's profile photo.            |


</dd>


5. Select the *Queries* tab on the Entity Explorer on the left side of the screen, then click the **+ New Query / API** button to create a new query.

6. Select the Users datasource from the list of options, then rename the query to `updateUsers`.

7. Update the SQL command in the query editor to update the users table with the details edited in the Form.

<dd>

```sql
UPDATE public."users" 
SET name = {{nameInput.text}}, 
    dob = {{dobInput.selectedDate}} 
WHERE id = {{usersTable.selectedRow.id}};
```

</dd>

8. Navigate back to the canvas by selecting the **UI** tab in the Entity Explorer.


9. To update the database when the Submit button is clicked:

<dd>

- Select the default Submit button on the form and rename it to Update.
- In the **onClick** event, set the action to Execute the `updateUsers`. This runs the query to update the database with the modified details.
- In the onSuccess callback, set the action to Execute a query > getUsers. This refreshes the table data to reflect the updated user details.

Now, select a row in the table widget to display the user's details in the form. After making the necessary updates, click Update to save the changes to the database and refresh the table with the updated data.









</dd>






  :::caution
  The databases used in tutorials are public and shared by all Appsmith users, so ensure that you don't input confidential information during testing. The databases are automatically reset every day, so any updates made to these databases are temporary.
