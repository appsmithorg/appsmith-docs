# Lesson 3 - Now Code It

This tutorial takes you through the process of writing JavaScript code in Appsmith. In the earlier lessons, you have written JS code inside the mustache syntax `{{}}` which is great for single-line coding. If you want to write more complex code, you have to use JS Objects.

## Write JS functions

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "calc(50.520833333333336% + 41px)", height: "0", width: "100%" }}>
  <iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/mp0l5PT6JndQqzxWAk0X?embed" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style={{ position: "absolute", top: "0", left: "0", width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "light" }} title="Appsmith | Connect Data">
  </iframe>
</div>

1. Select the **JS** tab on the *Entity Explorer* to the screen's left. 

2. Click the **+ New JS object** to create new JS Object. 

3. Delete everything within `export default {}`. Instead, paste the following function inside the braces.

  ```javascript
  getBackground: (gender) => {
    if (gender == 'male') return "#42f587";
    else if (gender == 'female') return "#f5e942";
    else return "#f57b42";
  }
  ```
  This function returns a different hex color code based on gender. 

4. Go back to the canvas by clicking the page name or the **UI** tab.

5. Select the `usersTable` Table. 

6. Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è next to the **gender** column. Click on the **Style** tab.

7. In the **Cell Background** property, click the **JS** button and paste the following code snippet to call the function to return the color code based on the gender of the user in the current table row.

  ```js
  {{JSObject1.getBackground(currentRow.gender)}}
  ```

  You will see the cell color change based on the value in the gender column.

## Use built-in objects and functions

Appsmith provides global objects and functions within its framework to help build your apps. 

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "calc(50.520833333333336% + 41px)", height: "0", width: "100%" }}>
  <iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/5lOBkGnAvnfbBFsKpC4h?embed" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style={{ position: "absolute", top: "0", left: "0", width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "light" }} title="Appsmith | Connect Data">
  </iframe>
</div>

1. Let's show an alert message after the update query runs. Click the **Update** button in the Form widget. In the **onClick** event, click the **JS** button to the right. Modify the code as shown below.
  ```javascript
  {{
    updateUsers.run().then(() => {
    showAlert('Record updated');
    getUsers.run();
    });
  }}
  ```
  Test by editing any record and click the **Update** button to see the alert message pop up on the top of the screen.

2. Create a new blank page by clicking on the **+** next to **Pages** on the Entity Explorer to the left of the screen. Rename the page to `Account Details`.  


3. Let's display the name of the currently logged-in user. Drop a Text widget at the top of this page. You will see your name or email id by default. Take a look at the **Text** property on the right. It contains the following code snippet.

  ```javascript
  Hello {{appsmith.user.name || appsmith.user.email}}
  ```
  Here you are using the `appsmith` global object to extract information about the currently logged-in user and append it to the text `Hello`. For more information, refer to [appsmith](/reference/appsmith-framework/context-object) global object.

### Navigate to another page  

1. You can also navigate from one page to another. Go back to the **User Information** page. Drop a button widget anywhere on the canvas. Change its **Label** property to `Next Page`.

2. In the **onClick** property, click the **JS** button. 

3. Between the curly braces `{{}}` enter the following code snippet

  ```javascript
  navigateTo('Account Details')
  ```

4. Click the **Next Page** button to test if it redirects you to the **Account Details** page. 

For more information on all the global functions available in the Appsmith framework, see [Global Functions](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions).


5. Click the **Deploy** button on the top right of the screen to deploy the application and test it in the *View* mode.

üö© Congratulations! You have built your first app that can display data from the database and save the updated data using a form.

In this tutorial, you explored a few different widgets and created a simple database GUI to view, query, and update data on a sample PostgreSQL database. You can use these skills to build your own app.

Happy App Building!
