# Kubernetes

This page provides steps to upgrade Appsmith Kubernetes Community Edition to Business Edition.

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading, ensure you have:

- Signed up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com/) and generated a trial license key.
- At least 2 GB of free storage space for the backup process.
- Deployed the latest version of Appsmith. Refer to [Update Appsmith](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/update-appsmith#kubernetes) to update the version.
- Created a backup of your Appsmith instance. For instructions, see [Backup Appsmith Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl?current-command-type=kubernetes-commands#backup-instance).

## Upgrade to Business Edition

Follow these steps to upgrade your Appsmith installation:

1. Create a folder named `appsmith-ee` on your machine for deployment and data storage. Then, navigate to this folder using the `cd` command.

2. Add the Appsmith chart repository with:

   ```bash
   helm repo add appsmith-ee https://helm-ee.appsmith.com
   ```

3. Load the Appsmith chart repository with:

   ```bash
   helm repo update
   ```

4. Generate the business edition `values.yaml` with:

   ```bash
   helm show values appsmith-ee/appsmith > values.yaml
   ``` 

5. Deploy Appsmith with:

   ```bash
   # Give a desired name to your namespace by replacing <NAMESPACE> 
   helm install appsmith appsmith-ee/appsmith -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace
   ```

6. Restore the backup data using the [Restore Appsmith instance](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl?current-command-type=kubernetes-commands#restore-instance).

7. Restart the pods with:

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart statefulsets/appsmith -n <NAMESPACE>
   ```

8. Get pod name with:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n <NAMESPACE>
   ```

9. Verify the installation locally by forwarding port 8080 to 80 with:
 
   ```bash
   # Replace the <NAMESPACE> with the your namespace 
   kubectl --namespace <NAMESPACE> port-forward appsmith-0 8080:80
   ```

10. Open [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) and wait for the server to come up. It can take up to 5 minutes. Once the server is up and running, access Appsmith at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).

11. Log into your Appsmith account and enter your license key to activate the instance.

12. After successfully verifying the Appsmith Business Edition installation, you may choose to delete the Community Edition namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete ns <COMMUNITY_EDITION_NAMESPACE>
   ```
