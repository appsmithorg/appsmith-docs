# Docker

Follow the steps listed below to upgrade your Community Edition (CE) to a Business Edition (BE) installed on docker.

## Step 1: Database backup

The Community and Business editions use MongoDB, so you don't have to migrate the database. It's still recommended to [backup the Community Edition MongoDB](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#export-database).

> Ensure that you backup the database with the docker instance **up** and **running**.

## Step 2: Update image

If you are using `docker run`, head to [Step 4: Recreate the instance](#step-4-recreate-the-instance).

Go to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file, and look for the `image:` key. Update the image in the `docker-compose.yml` file from Community Edition (_appsmith-ce_) to Business Edition (_appsmith-ee_). 

The updated file should have the image attribute set as below and save the file:

 ``` yaml
  services:
    appsmith:
    #highlight-next-line
      image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

## Step 3: Add or replace license key

Go to the directory `stacks/configuration` and open the `docker.env` file. Add/replace the Business Edition license key and save the file.

```bash
APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY=<ENTER_THE_LICENSE_KEY>
```

## Step 4: Recreate the instance

<Tabs groupId="dockercommands">
 <TabItem label="Docker Compose" value="using-docker-compose-command">
 You can recreate the instance by running the below command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

:::note
If you have **only** replaced the license key then you have to run the following command to restart the instance.

```bash
docker-compose restart appsmith
```
:::


You have successfully upgraded the docker instance to the Business Edition. Once the container is up and running, you can verify that the business image (_appsmith-ee_) is in use. Use the `docker ps` command to verify the image name.

 <TabItem label="Docker" value="using-docker-run-command">
  Go to the root directory of the docker installation and run the following commands: 

```bash
docker rmi appsmith/appsmith-ce -f
#highlight-next-line
docker pull appsmith/appsmith-ee
docker rm -f appsmith
#highlight-next-line
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

Once the download is complete, the server should be up. You should see `Appsmith is Running!` in the Docker logs (`stacks/logs/backend/backend.log`).

## Rollback (optional)

Follow the below steps to rollback to the Community Edition.

<Tabs groupId="dockercommands">
 <TabItem label="Docker Compose" value="using-docker-compose-command">

1. Stop the docker instance by using

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

2. Go to the directory (`stacks\configuration`) and open the `docker.env`. Remove the license key (APPSMITH\_LICENSE\_KEY)
3. Go to the `docker-compose.yml` file, and look for the `image:` key. Update the image in the `docker-compose.yml` file from Business Edition (_appsmith-ee_) to Community Edition (_appsmith-ce_). 

The updated file should have the image attribute set as below:

``` yaml
services:
  appsmith:
    #highlight-next-line
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

4. Recreate the instance by running the below command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
You have successfully upgraded the docker instance to the Business Edition. Once the container is up and running, you can verify that the business image (_appsmith-ee_) is in use. Use the `docker ps` command to verify the image name.

docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

Once the download is complete, the server should be up. You should see `Appsmith is Running!` in the Docker logs (`stacks/logs/backend/backend.log`).
