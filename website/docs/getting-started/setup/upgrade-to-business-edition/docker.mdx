# Docker

The page provides steps to upgrade the Appsmith Docker community edition to the Business edition.

## Prerequisites

- Sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com/) and generate a trial license key.
- Ensure you have at least 2 GB of free storage space for running the backup process.
- Create a backup of the Appsmith instance before upgrading. For more information, see [Backup Appsmith Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#backup-instance)
- Ensure that you have the latest Appsmith version deployed on your instance. To update Appsmith, see the [Update Appsmith](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/update-appsmith) section.

## Upgrade Appsmith instance

Follow these steps to upgrade your Appsmith instance:

1. Go to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file, and search for the `image:` key.
3. Update the value of the `image:` key as below:

``` yaml
  services:
    appsmith:
    #highlight-next-line
      image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
```
4. Save the file

5. Recreate the instance with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

6. Open [https://localhost](https://localhost) and wait for the server to come up. This can take up to 5 minutes. Once the server is up and running, verify the upgrade with:

```bash
# verify the image name as (appsmith-ee) in use 
docker ps
```
You have successfully upgraded your Docker instance to the Business Edition. 

7.  Log into your Appsmith account, and enter your license key to activate the instance.

## Troubleshooting

If you come across any errors, begin by [Restoring the Appsmith instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl?current-command-type=docker-commands#restore-instance) to the [backup version](#prerequisites) and contact [support@appsmith.com](mailto:support@appsmith.com).
