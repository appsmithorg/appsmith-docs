# Docker

Follow the steps listed below to upgrade your Appsmith Community Edition (CE) to a Appsmith Business Edition (BE) installed on docker.

## Generate license key

Sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com/) and generate a trial license key.

## Backup data

The Community and Business editions use MongoDB, so you don't have to migrate the database. It's still recommended to [backup the Community Edition data](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#backup). Ensure that you backup the database with the docker instance up and running.

## Update image

If you are using `docker run`, head to [Step 4: Recreate the instance](#recreate-the-instance).

Go to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file, and look for the `image:` key. Update the image in the `docker-compose.yml` file from Community Edition (_appsmith-ce_) to Business Edition (_appsmith-ee_). 

The updated file should have the image attribute set as below and save the file:

``` yaml
  services:
    appsmith:
    #highlight-next-line
      image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

## Recreate the instance

<Tabs groupId="dockercommands" queryString="current-docker-command">
 <TabItem label="Docker Compose" value="using-docker-compose-command">
 You can recreate the instance by running the below command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

:::note
If you have **only** replaced the license key then you have to run the following command to restart the instance.

```bash
docker-compose restart appsmith
```
:::


You have successfully upgraded the docker instance to the Business Edition. Once the container is up and running, you can verify that the business image (_appsmith-ee_) is in use. Use the `docker ps` command to verify the image name.

 </TabItem>
 <TabItem label="Docker run" value="using-docker-run-command">
  Go to the root directory of the docker installation and run the following commands: 

```bash
docker rmi appsmith/appsmith-ce -f
#highlight-next-line
docker pull appsmith/appsmith-ee
docker rm -f appsmith
#highlight-next-line
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

Once the download is complete, the server should be up. You should see `Appsmith is Running!` in the Docker logs (`stacks/logs/backend/backend.log`).

## Enter license key

Sign in to your instance again. On successful login, you see a screen where you can enter the license key and activate the instance.
