Follow the steps below to upgrade the Docker Community edition to the Business edition:

<ul class="circle"> 
<li> Create a backup of the CE data. Run the below command in the directory with <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. The output file is stored in <code>/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/</code>

        docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl backup
</li>

<li> Open the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and look for the <code>image:</code> key. Update the image from Community Edition (<code>appsmith-ce</code>) to Business Edition (<code>appsmith-ee</code>).

        services:
      appsmith:
        image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
  </li>
<li> Recreate the instance by running the following command:

        docker-compose up -d
</li>
<li>Sign in to your instance again. On successful login, you see a screen where you can enter the license key and activate the instance. </li>

</ul>
