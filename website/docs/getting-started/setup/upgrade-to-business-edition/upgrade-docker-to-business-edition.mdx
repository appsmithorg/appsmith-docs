Follow the steps below to upgrade Docker Community edition to Business edition:

1. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and look for the `image:` key. Update the image from Community Edition (`appsmith-ce`) to Business Edition (`appsmith-ee`).

  ```javascript
    services:
      appsmith:
        image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
  ```
2. Recreate the instance by running the following command:

  ```javascript
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
3. Sign-in to your instance again. Upon successful login, you see a screen where you can enter the license key and activate the instance.
