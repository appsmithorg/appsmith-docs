##### `APPSMITH_EMAIL_SERVER_PORT`

<dd>

Defines the port number for the email server. The port number depends on the email server's configuration and the protocol in use. For instance, port 25 is typically used for non-encrypted transport, 587 for submission with StartTLS, and 465 for SMTPS (deprecated). Set this variable to match the port number of your email server's configuration.
