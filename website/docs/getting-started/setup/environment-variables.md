# Environment Variables

Environment variables play a crucial role in configuring different aspects of your Appsmith instance, such as authentication, logging levels, email settings, and more. These variables are available in a configuration file located in your Appsmith installation directory. For example, if you’ve installed Appsmith using Docker, you’ll find the `docker.env` file under `<Appsmith_Installation_Directory>/stacks/configuration`. This page provides a detailed description of each environment variable, along with its purpose and usage.

:::caution important
Settings configured using Environment Variables take precedence over those set through the [Admin Settings](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/admin-settings) UI.
:::

### Admin email

The following environment variable is used to set up instance administrator for your Appsmith instance.

##### `APPSMITH_ADMIN_EMAILS`

<dd>
    Specify the email addresses of users who will have Instance Administrator privileges. These administrators have full control over all instance settings. To assign more than one user as Instance Administrator, separate their email addresses with commas. For example: `admin@techcorp.com, supportadmin@techcorp.com`. This grants Instance Administrator access to both users. For more information about Instance Administrator permissions, see the [Instance Administrator](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/default-roles#instance-administrator-role) Role.

</dd>

### Embed Appsmith

Embedding your Appsmith apps on external websites can expose them to clickjacking attacks. To mitigate this, Appsmith uses the `Content-Security-Policy` header with the `frame-ancestors` directive. For more details, refer to the [frame-ancestors documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors).

Starting from Appsmith `v1.7.10`, apps are restricted from being loaded in a frame or iframe on domains other than the app's own domain. For instance, if your Appsmith instance is hosted at `http://mydomain.com`, only pages on `http://mydomain.com` can embed its apps.

You can configure or customize this behavior by using below environment variable:

##### `APPSMITH_ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTORS`

<dd>
This variable allows you to specify which domains can embed your Appsmith apps in a frame or iframe. Below are some examples:

- **Specific domain**: To allow a specific domain, such as `http://trusted-other.com`, use:

  ```yaml
  APPSMITH_ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTORS="'self' http://trusted-other.com"
  ```

- **Multiple domains**: To allow multiple domains, separate them with spaces:

  ```yaml
  APPSMITH_ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTORS="'self' http://trusted-other.com http://another-trusted.com"
  ```

- **Subdomains**: To allow all subdomains under `trusted-other.com`, use:

  ```yaml
  APPSMITH_ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTORS="'self' http://*.trusted-other.com"
  ```
</dd>
For more information about embedding Appsmith, see the [Embed Appsmith](/advanced-concepts/embed-appsmith-into-existing-application) guide.

### Git Local File Path

Appsmith clones Git repositories to the local file system, which is attached to the persistent volume within the Docker container. To ensure the repositories are maintained across restarts, you need to specify a file path that points to the volume within the Docker container.

##### `APPSMITH_GIT_ROOT`

<dd>
This environment variable allows you to set a custom Git root path for your Appsmith Git repositories, enabling local repositories to be created and persisted on your machine. To set the custom root path, use the following command:

```bash
APPSMITH_GIT_ROOT=<path-to-repo-directory>
```
If this file path is not configured, repositories will be cloned but will not persist. This can lead to data loss during events like a Docker restart. Appsmith will attempt to re-clone the repositories if they are deleted, but configuring persistent storage is essential to avoid any potential loss of data.
</dd>

### Client logging

Appsmith provides a way to enhance the log levels of your applications, aiding in monitoring client-side operations and troubleshooting issues. The following environment variable helps define the verbosity level of the logs that Appsmith will generate for client-side activities.
