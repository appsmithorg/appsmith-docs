# Email

This page guides you through configuring an email service provider on your self-hosted instance. By configuring email, you can leverage the below capabilities:

* Invite users to join your Appsmith workspace by sending email invitations.
* Reset password using password reset emails.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have:

* Access to your Appsmith instance.
* Access to your account with the email service provider.

## Configure email
 On Appsmith, you can configure email by using one of the following ways:

* [Admin settings](#admin-settings)
* [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)

### Admin settings

:::caution Attention
If you have configured email using [environment variables](#environment-variables) for your instance, it takes precedence over the configuration provided through the Admin Settings UI.
:::

Follow these steps to configure your email provider using Admin Settings:

1. Log into your Appsmith instance as a superuser.

2. Go to the **Admin Settings** screen.

3. Select **Email** from the left nav bar.

4. Add the configuration details for your email provider as below:   

   | Name	| Description |
   |-----------|--------------|
   | **SMTP Host** |	Add the SMTP host of your email service provider. |
   | **SMTP Port**	| Add the SMTP port of your email service provider. |
   | **From Address**	| Add a verified email address to be shown in the **From** field when users receive an email. |
   | **Reply To Address**	| Add a verified email address, so that users can reach out to you. |
   |  **TLS Protected Connection**	|  By default, this option is turned off. Toggle it to enable TLS. |
   | **SMTP Username** |	Add the username for your email service provider. This is only needed when TLS is turned on. |
   | **SMTP Password**	| Add the password for your email service provider. This is only needed when TLS is turned on. |

5. Click the **SEND TEST EMAIL** button to verify the configuration. A toast message appears at the top of the page, indicating the success or failure of the test. Additionally, a test email is sent to your inbox on successful verification.

6. Click the **SAVE & RESTART** button to save the configurations and restart the instance with the updated settings.

### Environment variables

Follow these steps to configure your email provider using environment variables:

1. Go to your Appsmith instance configuration file. For example, the `docker-compose.yml` file for Docker and the `values.yaml` file for Kubernetes.

2. Update the values of the environment variables as shown below:

   |Variable	| Description |
   |-----------|--------------|
   | `APPSMITH_MAIL_ENABLED` | Set it to true to enable the email service. |
   | `APPSMITH_MAIL_FROM`	| Set it to the verified email of the sender. |
   | `APPSMITH_REPLY_TO`	| Set it to the email that should receive replies by default. |
   | `APPSMITH_MAIL_HOST`	| Set it to the SMTP Host of the email service provider. |
   | `APPSMITH_MAIL_PORT`	| Set it to the SMTP Port of the email service provider. |
   | `APPSMITH_MAIL_SMTP_TLS_ENABLED` |	Set it to `true to enable transport layer security. |
   | `APPSMITH_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH`	| set it to share the credentials `APPSMITH_MAIL_USERNAME` and `APPSMITH_MAIL_PASSWORD` with the SMTP server. |
   | `APPSMITH_MAIL_USERNAME` |	Set it to the username for accessing the SMTP service provider.
   | `APPSMITH_MAIL_PASSWORD` |	Set it to the password for the SMTP user. Alternatively, you can use the API key generated by the email service provider for the SMTP user. |

3. Restart the instance.
