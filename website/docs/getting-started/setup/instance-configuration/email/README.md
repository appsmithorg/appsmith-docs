# Email

[Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) is a widely used service to communicate with your users. You can set up email integration on your Appsmith instance to:

* Invite users to your Appsmith workspace
* Notify admins of important events & approval requests

Appsmith allows you to configure email using environment variables or the [admin settings](../admin-settings.md#using-the-admin-settings-ui).
