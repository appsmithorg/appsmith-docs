# Email

[Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) is a widely used service to communicate with your users. You can set up email integration on your Appsmith instance to:

* Invite users to your Appsmith workspace
* Notify admins of important events & approval requests
* Handle user management emails such as invites and password resets

:::note
[Password resets](/help-and-support/troubleshooting-guide/application-errors#reset-password-error) for user accounts are handled by emails from the Appsmith instance. If you would like users to be able to perform this action, ensure that your instance has been configured to handle email notifications. 
:::

Appsmith allows you to configure email using environment variables or the [admin settings](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration).

## Environment variables

Appsmith requires the following environment variables to be configured:

:::note
Be sure to double-check your configuration if you find that you're able to send test mail but not invites or password resets.

[Restart the Appsmith instance](../) once the environment variables are configured.

## Admin settings

:::info

* Navigate to **profile** >> **Admin Settings** >> Select **Email.**

*   Add configuration details provided by your email service provider.

    * **SMTP Host** - SMTP host of your email service provider
    * **SMTP Port** - SMTP port of your email service provider
    * **From Address** - a verified email address to be shown in the <mark >`from field`</mark> when users receive an email
    * **TLS Protected Connection** - Bey default is enabled. Toggle back to disable
    * **SMTP Username** - Add the username for your email service provider
