# Gmail

This page guides you through configuring Gmail as an email service provider on your self-hosted instance.

## Prerequisites

- A self-hosted Appsmith instance. See the [installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) to set up your Appsmith instance.
- A Google Workspace account. Sign up on the [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_in/), if you don't have one.

## Create app password

If you've set up 2-Step Verification for your Google account and want to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for configuring Gmail, then you must set up a Google app password.

If not, skip this section and move to the [Configure Gmail on Appsmith](#configure-gmail-on-appsmith) section.

Follow these steps to set up a Google app password:

1. Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Select **Security** from the sidebar.
3. Under the **How you sign in to Google** section, select **2-Step Verification**.
4. Scroll down and select **App passwords**.
5. On the App passwords screen, choose the options as shown below:

   - Choose **Mail** for **Select app**.
   - Choose **Other** for **Select device**, and enter a name for your Appsmith instance.

6. Click the **Generate** button to create the app password.
7. Copy the generated app password on the next screen, and keep it safe. You need it to configure Gmail on Appsmith in the next section.

## Configure Gmail on Appsmith

:::info
Google limits sending messages. For more information, see [Gmail sending limits in Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852#).
:::

On Appsmith, you can configure email by using one of the following ways:

- [Admin settings](#admin-settings)
- [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)

### Admin settings

:::caution Attention
If you have configured email using [environment variables](#environment-variables) for your instance, it takes precedence over the configuration provided through the Admin Settings UI.
:::

Follow these steps to configure your email provider using Admin Settings:

1. Log into your Appsmith instance as a superuser.

2. Go to the **Admin Settings** screen.

3. Select **Email** from the left nav bar.
