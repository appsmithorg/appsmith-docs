# Configure Google Maps

This page provides instructions to integrate Google Maps for using the [Map Widget](/reference/widgets/maps) in your applications on a self-hosted instance.

## Prerequisites

- A self-hosted Appsmith instance. See the [installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) for details.
- A [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) account.
- You are either an [Instance Administrator](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/default-roles#instance-administrator-role) or have permissions to access Admin settings.

## Generate Google Maps API key (optional)

If you already have an API key, skip to the [Set up Maps API key](#set-up-maps-api-key) section. Otherwise, follow these steps to generate an API key:

1. Log into the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Generate a Google Maps API key by following the [Create API keys](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#create-api-keys) guide.
3. Restrict the Google Maps API key using the [Restrict API keys](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#restrict_key) guide.
4. Ensure that **Maps Embed API**, **Maps JavaScript API**, **Places API**, and **Geolocation API** are enabled during the API key restriction process.

## Configure Maps API key

To configure the API key via Admin Settings, follow these steps:

:::caution Attention
If an API key is configured using an environment variable, it takes precedence over the value set via Admin Settings. To configure using environment variables, see the [Google Maps API key environment variable](/getting-started/setup/environment-variables#appsmith_google_maps_api_key) reference.
:::

1. Log into your Appsmith instance.
2. Go to **Admin Settings** by clicking the gear (⚙️) icon in the top right corner of your Appsmith Dashboard.
3. Click the **Developer settings** from the sidebar.

    <ZoomImage

        alt="Google Maps API Key."
        caption="Add your Google Maps API Key"
    />

4. Enter your API key in the **Google Maps API Key** field.
5. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

You're all set to use the Map Widget in your Appsmith applications.
