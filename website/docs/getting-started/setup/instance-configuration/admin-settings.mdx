# Admin Settings

Appsmith allows instance administrators to manage settings through the **Admin Settings** page. These settings control all instance-wide configurations, including email settings, authentication methods, session management, and more. This page provides details about these settings and their configurations. 

:::caution important
 **Note:** Settings configured via environment variables override any settings configured via the Admin Settings UI.

## General

This section provides information on configuration changes related to instance name, setting up instance administrators for your instance, Appsmith watermark and more.

### Instance name

<dd>
Modify the name of your self-hosted Appsmith instance. This name is displayed in all places within the Appsmith platform, such as the top bar and login screen. You can customize this to suit your organization's branding.
</dd>

### Admin email

<dd>
Enter the email addresses of users you want to assign the **Instance Administrator** role. Multiple emails can be added, separated by commas. Instance Administrators have full control over instance settings and user management. For more information on the Instance Administrator role, see [Instance Administrator Role](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/default-roles#instance-administrator-role). 

If you don’t see the Admin Settings icon on the top-right corner, you’re not an Instance Administrator for the Appsmith instance and must be granted instance administrator role by an existing instance administrator. 
</dd>

### Share anonymous usage data

<dd>
This setting controls whether your Appsmith instance shares anonymous usage data with Appsmith to help improve the product. You can opt in or opt out at any time. This data helps Appsmith understand user behavior and make improvements.
For more on the data shared, see [Appsmith Telemetry](#telemetry).
</dd>

### Appsmith watermark

### Session timeout

<dd>
Set the inactivity timeout period for user sessions. If a user remains inactive for the specified time, they will automatically be logged out. The format is `DD:HH:MM`, with a minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 30 days.
