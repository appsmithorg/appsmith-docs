# Admin Settings

Appsmith allows instance administrators to manage settings through the **Admin Settings** page. These settings control all instance-wide configurations, including email settings, authentication methods, session management, and more. This page provides details about these settings and their configurations.

:::caution important
**Note:** Settings configured via environment variables override any settings configured via the Admin Settings UI.
:::

## General

The **General** section provides essential configurations for your instance, including its name, administrator setup, session policies, and more.

### Instance name

<dd>
The **Instance name** is displayed prominently across your Appsmith instance, including on the top bar and login screen. It helps users identify your organization’s Appsmith deployment. **Example**: Setting this to "TechCorp Appsmith" aligns the branding with your company’s identity.
</dd>

### Admin email

<dd>
Specify the email addresses of users who will have **Instance Administrator** privileges. These administrators have full control over all instance settings. Separate multiple email addresses with commas. **Example**: `admin@techcorp.com, support@techcorp.com`.  
For more information about instance administrator permissions, see [Instance Administrator Role](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/default-roles#instance-administrator-role).
</dd>

### Share anonymous usage data

<dd>
Enabling this setting allows Appsmith to collect anonymous usage data to improve the product by analyzing performance and usage patterns. This data is anonymized and helps enhance user experience.  
For more details, see [Appsmith Telemetry](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/configure-using-environment-variables#telemetry).
</dd>

### Appsmith watermark

<dd>
This toggle controls the visibility of the **Built on Appsmith** watermark on your applications. To remove this watermark, upgrade to the [Commercial Edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).
</dd>

### Programmatic access to users and groups

<dd>
Allows developers to access user roles and group information programmatically within their apps. This feature is particularly useful for implementing role-based logic, such as restricting access to specific actions or pages based on user roles.  
For implementation examples, see [Restrict Query Access](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/how-to-guides/restrict-query-access#prerequisites).
</dd>

### User session limit

<dd>
Limits each user to a single active session at any time. If a user logs in on a new device, their previous session will automatically be logged out.
</dd>

### Session timeout

<dd>
Automatically logs users out after a specified period of inactivity. The duration is set in `DD:HH:MM` format. **Example**: Setting this to `00:30:00` logs out inactive users after 30 minutes.
</dd>

### Atomic pushes to Git

<dd>
Ensures that Git pushes happen atomically, which minimizes errors during synchronization. This is critical for maintaining consistency in apps linked to version control.  
For more details, see [Version Control with Git](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git).
</dd>

### Embed settings

<dd>
Configure how Appsmith applications can be embedded in external websites or platforms. Options include:
