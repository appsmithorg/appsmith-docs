# Admin Settings

The Admin Settings page allows [instance administrators](#add-instance-administrator) on self-hosted instances to manage instance configurations, including email, authentication, Google Maps integration, as well as user settings and permissions. This page provides instructions on how to manage your self-hosted Appsmith instance using Admin Settings.

:::info
If you don’t see the _Admin Settings_ icon in the top-right corner, you’re not an Instance Administrator for the Appsmith instance and must be granted instance administrator role by an existing instance administrator.

If you have set values using [environment variables](#environment-variables) for your instance, those values take precedence over values specified in the Admin Settings UI.

### Add Instance Administrator

Users who are granted the Instance Administrator role have full access to all the instance settings. 
If you want to grant Instance Administrator privileges to a user, add their email address to the **Admin email** field in the **Settings** > **General** section. Doing so automatically assigns them the Instance Administrator role, giving them full access to manage instance settings. For more information about Instance Administrator role, see [Instance Administrator Role](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/default-roles#instance-administrator-role) reference.
