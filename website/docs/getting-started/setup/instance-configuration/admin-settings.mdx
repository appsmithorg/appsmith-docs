# Admin Settings

Appsmith allows instance administrators to manage settings through the **Admin Settings** page. These settings control all instance-wide configurations, including email settings, authentication methods, session management, and more. This page provides details about these settings and their configurations.

:::caution important
Settings configured via [Environment Variables](/getting-started/setup/environment-variables) override any settings configured via the Admin Settings UI.
:::

## General

The **General** section provides essential configurations for your instance, including its name, administrator setup, session policies, and more.

#### Instance name

<dd>
The **Instance name** is displayed prominently across your Appsmith instance, including on the top bar and login screen. It helps users identify your organization’s Appsmith deployment. For example, setting this to _TechCorp Appsmith_ aligns the branding with your company’s identity.
</dd>

#### Admin email

<dd>
Specify the email addresses of users who will have **Instance Administrator** privileges. These administrators have full control over all instance settings. Separate multiple email addresses with commas. For example, `admin@techcorp.com, supportadmin@techcorp.com`. For more information about instance administrator permissions, see [Instance Administrator Role](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/default-roles#instance-administrator-role).
</dd>

#### Share anonymous usage data

<dd>
Enabling this setting allows Appsmith to collect anonymous usage data to improve the product by analyzing performance and usage patterns. This data is anonymized and helps enhance user experience. For more details, see [Appsmith Telemetry](/product/telemetry).
</dd>

#### Appsmith watermark

<dd>
This toggle controls the visibility of the **Built on Appsmith** watermark on your applications. To remove this watermark, upgrade to the [Commercial Edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).
</dd>

#### Programmatic access to users and groups

<dd>
Allows developers to access user roles and group information programmatically within their apps. This feature is particularly useful for implementing role-based logic, such as restricting access to specific actions or pages based on user roles. For implementing restricted access, see [Restrict Query Access](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/how-to-guides/restrict-query-access).
</dd>

#### User session limit

<dd>
Limits each user to a single active session at any time. If a user logs in on a new device, their previous session will automatically be logged out.
</dd>

#### Session timeout

<dd>
Automatically logs users out after a specified period of inactivity. The default duration is set to `30:00:00` (30 days). The duration is set in `DD:HH:MM` format and can be set between 1 minute and 30 days. For example, setting this to `00:00:30` logs out inactive users after 30 minutes. To change it, enter the new duration in `DD:HH:MM` format.
</dd>

#### Atomic pushes to Git

<dd>
Atomic pushes ensure that Git changes are pushed to the remote repository as a single, indivisible operation. This means that either all changes are applied, or none are, preventing partial updates that may lead to errors or inconsistent states in the repository.

When using Bitbucket, atomic pushes can improve consistency like in complex workflows or when different systems are interacting with the repository. While Bitbucket supports atomic pushes, some other Git providers like Azure Repos may not fully support this feature in the same way. 
</dd>

#### Embed settings

<dd>
Configure how Appsmith applications can be embedded in external websites or platforms. Options include:

- **Allow embedding everywhere**: When selected, Appsmith can be embedded in any domain and application.
- **Limit embedding to certain URLs**: When selected, Appsmith can be embedded in the specified applications only.
      Below are some examples:

            - **Specific domain**: To allow a specific domain add the domain as shown below:

                  ```javascript
                  http://trusted-other.com
                  ```

            - **Multiple domains**: To add more than one domain, separate them with spaces:

                  ```javascript
                  http://trusted-other.com http://another-trusted.com
                  ```

            - **Subdomains**: To allow all subdomains under `trusted-other.com`, use asterisk (*) as shown below:
                  ```javascript
                  http://*.trusted-other.com
                  ```
- **Disabling embedding everywhere**: When selected, Appsmith cannot be embedded.

For more information about embedding Appsmith, see [Embed Appsmith](/advanced-concepts/embed-appsmith-into-existing-application) guide.
</dd>
