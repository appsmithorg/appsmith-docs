# Custom CA Root Certificate

When interacting with internal endpoints that use private SSL certificates, or if your Appsmith instance is behind a firewall or proxy requiring SSL decryption, you may need to configure custom CA root certificates. This page provides instructions on setting up custom CA root certificates in your Appsmith installation.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring custom CA root certificates for Appsmith installation, ensure the following requirements are met:
1. A self-hosted Appsmith instance installed. If not already installed, refer to the [installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides). This guide assumes you are working with an existing installation.
2. Ensure your CA certificates are valid and allow secure HTTPS connections to the server. Verify the certificate using the following command:  
    ```bash
    curl --cacert <cert_path> https://domain/
    ```

## Set up custom CA root certificates

Follow the steps below to set up custom CA root certificates for your installation platform:

To set up custom CA certificates in Docker:  

:::caution
Removing a certificate from the `ca-certs` folder will also remove it from the trust store, resulting in the certificate no longer being trusted.
:::

1. Create a `ca-certs` folder inside your `stacks` folder.  
2. Save all CA root certificates in the `ca-certs` folder.  
   - If your certificate file has a `.pem` extension, rename it to `.crt` before adding it to the `stacks/ca-certs` folder.  
3. Restart Appsmith.  

Appsmith checks the `ca-certs` folder for CA root certificates and applies them on startup.

To set up custom CA certificates in Kubernetes:  

1. Open the `values.yaml` file.  
2. Locate the `customCAcert` section.  
3. Add your certificates by pasting their content as shown:  

    ```yaml
    customCAcert:
      cert1: |
        (Paste the certificate content here)
      cert2: |
        (Paste additional certificate content here)
    ```

4. Save the file and run the following Helm upgrade command to apply your changes:  

    ```bash
    helm upgrade -i appsmith-ee appsmith-ee/appsmith -n appsmith-ee -f values.yaml
    ```

These steps add your custom certificates to the Appsmith trust store.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up custom CA certificates:  

- **Unable to verify certificate**: Verify that the CA certificate is correctly formatted and added to the appropriate location (`stacks/ca-certs` for Docker or `values.yaml` for Kubernetes).  
- **Changes not applied**: Ensure you've restarted the Appsmith server. If not, try restarting the server.
- **Certificate no longer trusted**: Removing a certificate from the `ca-certs` folder removes it from the trust store, causing the certificate to no longer be trusted. Verify that you havenâ€™t accidentally removed any required certificates.

If you continue to face issues, contact the support team using the chat widget at the bottom right of this page.
