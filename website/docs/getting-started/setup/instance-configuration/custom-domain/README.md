# Custom Domain and SSL

This page explains how to set up SSL for your custom domain on the Appsmith instance.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring SSL for your custom domain, make sure you have the following:

1. A self-hosted Appsmith instance. If not yet installed, see the [installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) for installing Appsmith.
2. A domain name - You can get a custom domain from popular providers like [GoDaddy](https://in.godaddy.com/help/create-a-subdomain-4080), [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-subdomain-route-53/), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/how-to/add-subdomain/), [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9776/2237/how-to-create-a-subdomain-for-my-domain), and [Domain.com](https://www.domain.com/help/article/domain-management-how-to-update-subdomains).
3. Ports 80 and 443 are open and accessible. If using custom ports, ensure that they are open and accessible.
4. Access to Admin Settings. 

## Configure SSL

You can use your custom domain with the HTTP protocol, even if you haven't set up an SSL certificate yet, but it's recommended to configure SSL to ensure secure connections by using HTTPS. You can either set up [SSL using Let's Encrypt](#ssl-with-lets-encrypt-certificate) or add your [custom certificate](#ssl-using-custom-certificate) to secure your connections.

   For Kubernetes installations, see [How to configure TLS for Appsmith Kubernetes installation](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/custom-domain/configure-tls).

### SSL using Let’s Encrypt certificate

:::warning Attention
Let's Encrypt does not support provisioning a certificate for ephemeral domain names since they are high-risk.
:::

Follow these steps to generate and maintain an SSL certificate for your custom domain using Let’s Encrypt:

![Set up your custom domain using Admin settings](/img/setup-custom-domain-using-admin-settings.png)

1. Go to the _Admin Settings_ in your Appsmith instance.
2. Click **Advanced Settings** from the left navigation.
3. Add your custom domain name to the **Custom Domain** field.
4. Click the **SAVE & RESTART** button.

When Appsmith restarts, it will generate an SSL certificate for your custom domain. Access your Appsmith instance via HTTPS on port 443.

### SSL using custom certificate

Follow these steps to configure SSL using a custom SSL Certificate: 

1. Rename the certificate file as `fullchain.pem` and the key file as `privkey.pem`.
2. Verify that the private key file is valid by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   openssl pkey -in privkey.pem -pubout -outform pem | sha256sum
   ```
   When prompted enter the pass phrase. Take a note of the hash generated by the command.
3. Verify the public key in the certificate using this command:
   ``bash
   openssl x509 -in fullchain.pem -pubkey -noout -outform pem | sha256sum
   ```
   Verify the hash generated by above command with the hash generated by the command in step 2. Both checks produce matching hashes, confirming the integrity of the certificate and key pair.
4. Copy these files into the subdirectory `<MOUNTING-DIRECTORY>/ssl/`. Ensure that you change `<MOUNTING-DIRECTORY>` by the mounting volume directory available in the `docker-compose.yml`. For example, the default value is `./stacks`.
5. Go to the Admin Settings in your Appsmith instance. Under **Advanced Settings** - add your custom domain name to the **Custom Domain** field, and click the **SAVE & RESTART** button.
6. Open the terminal, go to the Appsmith installation directory, and restart the container using the below command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart appsmith
   ```
   The container uses the certificate present in the `<MOUNTING-DIRECTORY>/ssl` folder.

## Troubleshooting

You may face SSL/TLS certificate error while configuring SSL, follow the below guide to troubleshoot:
* [SSL/TLS Certificate Error](/help-and-support/troubleshooting-guide/deployment-errors#ssltls-certification-errors)

If you continue to face issues, contact the support team using the chat widget at the bottom right of this page.
