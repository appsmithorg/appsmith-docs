# Auth0

To configure Appsmith to use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as an OIDC provider, follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

1. In Appsmith, go to **Admin Settings** > **Authentication** and click **Enable** on  **OIDC**.

2. Copy the **Redirect URL** from the **OIDC** configuration page to add it later in the Auth0 settings.

## Create application in Auth0

1. Log in to your [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account and go to **Applications** > **Create Application**. 
2. In the **Create application** modal, select **Regular Web Application** and click **Create**.
3. Once your application is created, youâ€™re taken to the Quick Start screen. Go to the **Settings** tab.
4. In the basic information section, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to add them later in the OIDC configurations in Appsmith.
5. Scroll down to the **Application URIs** and paste the **Redirect URL** copied earlier in the **Allowed Callback URLs** field.
6. On the **Settings** tab, go to **Advanced Settings** > **Endpoints**. Copy the following URls from the OAuth section to add them later in the OIDC configurations in Appsmith:

    a. **OAuth Authorization URL**

    b. **OAuth Token URL**

    c. **OAuth User Info URL**

    d. **JSON Web Key Set**

6. Click **Save Changes**.

##  Register Auth0 in Appsmith

To complete the OIDC configuration, you have to register the identity provider on Appsmith. Open the OIDC configurations in Appsmith (**Admin Settings > Authentication > OIDC**), and follow the steps below:

1. Add the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** copied from the Auth0 application into the respective fields.

2. Add the URLs copied from the Auth0 application into OIDC configurations in Appsmith as per the table below:

| **Auth0 URLs**       |  **OIDC Fields** |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| OAuth Authorization URL | Authorization URL     |
| OAuth Token URL         | Token URL             |
| OAuth User Info URL      | User Info URL         |
| JSON Web Key Set              | JWK Set URL           |

3. In the **Scopes** section, add the attributes that allow you to authorize access to user details after a user is successfully authenticated. By default, there are three scopes - **openid**, **email**, **profile**. Appsmith needs **openid** and **email** as mandatory scopes.

:::info
Auth0 provides standard claims: openId, profile, and email as part of the authorization action. If you want to access additional user attributes, [configure them on Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes), and add them to the Scopes field in Appsmith's OIDC configurations.
:::

4. In the **Attributes** section, you have the option to specify which attributes you want to use as usernames for authentication. By default, the attribute **email** is added, indicating that the user's email address is used as the username for authentication.

Once you have added the details, click the **SAVE & RESTART** button to save the configuration and restart the instance. 

After the Appsmith instance restarts, try logging in again to your account. You'll see a login screen with the **SIGN IN WITH SAML OIDC** button.
