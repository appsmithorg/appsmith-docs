This page shows you how to configure Appsmith to use [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/) as an OIDC provider.

## Prerequisites

1. A self-hosted Appsmith instance. See the [installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) for installing Appsmith.

2. Before setting up Single Sign-On (SSO), ensure that you have already configured a [custom domain](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/custom-domain) for your instance.

3. In Appsmith, go to **Admin Settings > Authentication** and click **Enable** on **OIDC**.

4. Copy the **Redirect URL** from the **OIDC** configuration page to add it when creating the application in FusionAuth.

## Create application in FusionAuth

Follow these steps to set up your application in FusionAuth:


 <ZoomImage src="/img/fusion-auth-app.png" alt="" caption="" />

1. Log in to your [FusionAuth](https://login.fusionauth.io/admin) dashboard.

2. Navigate to Applications from the left-hand panel.

3. Click the green plus (**+**) icon in the top-right corner to create a new application.

4. Enter a name for your application.

5. Go to the **OAuth** tab and add the **Authorized redirect URLs**. Copy the Redirect URL from the OIDC configuration in Appsmith, for instance, `http://localhost/login/oauth2/code/oidc`. 

6. Save your application by clicking the Save icon at the top-right corner.

7. Open your application, go to the **OAuth** tab, and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to add them later in the OIDC configurations in Appsmith.




## Configure Issuer in FusionAuth

Follow these steps to set the Issuer URL in FusionAuth, which is crucial for secure OIDC integration and ensures the authorization server is correctly identified.

1. From the left panel, navigate to the **Tenants** section.

2. Select the default tenant or create a new one if needed.

3. In the **Edit Tenant** screen, add the prefix `https://` to the existing URL in the Issuer field. 

<dd>

For example, if your existing URL is `example.fusionauth.io`, it should be updated to `https://example.fusionauth.io`. 

</dd>

4. Save the changes.



##  Register FusionAuth in Appsmith

To complete the OIDC configuration, you have to register the identity provider on Appsmith. Go to **Admin Settings > Authentication > OIDC**, and follow the steps below:

1. Add the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** copied from the FusionAuth application into the respective fields.

2. Add the URLs copied from the `<your-FusionAuth-domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration` page into OIDC configurations in Appsmith as per the table below:

<dd>


  | **OIDC configuration field**       | **FusionAuth URL**  |
  | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
  | **Authorization URL** | authorization_endpoint     |
  | **Token URL**         | token_endpoint             |
  | **User Info URL**      | userinfo_endpoint         |
  | **JWK Set URL**             |  jwks_uri          |

</dd>


3. In the **Scope** box, specify the scopes to be used by the application during authentication to authorize access to a user's details. By default, there are three scopes - `openid`, `email`, and `profile`. 
 
 <dd>

  Appsmith needs `openid` and `email` as mandatory scopes. Itâ€™s also highly recommended to use the `offline_access` scope to avoid errors related to expired access tokens and excessive re-login requests. For more information, see [FusionAuth OAuth Scopes](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/scopes).

</dd>

4. In the **Username Attribute** box, specify the name of the claim which represents the email of the user. The default value is `email`.

Once you have added the details, click the **SAVE & RESTART** button to save the configuration and restart the instance. 

:::info
If you're running Appsmith on a **Kubernetes** cluster with an HA configuration, after completing the setup, run the following command to ensure the new authentication settings are properly applied:

```js
kubectl rollout restart deployment/appsmith -n
```
:::


After the Appsmith instance restarts, try logging in again to your account. You'll see a login screen with the **SIGN IN WITH OIDC SSO** button.
