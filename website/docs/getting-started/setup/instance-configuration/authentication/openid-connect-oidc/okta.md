To configure Appsmith to use [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) as an OIDC provider, follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

1. A self-hosted Appsmith instance. See the [installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) for installing Appsmith.

2. Before setting up Single Sign-On (SSO), ensure that you have already configured a [custom domain](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/custom-domain) for your instance.

3. In Appsmith, go to **Admin Settings > Authentication** and click **Enable** on **OIDC**.

4. Copy the **Redirect URL** from the **OIDC** configuration page to add it when creating the application in Okta.

</dd>

## Create application on Okta

1. Log in to your [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) account and click **Admin** from the top right corner.

2. Select **Create a new app integration** and configure as follows:

<dd>

- **Sign-in method:** OIDC - OpenID Connect

- **Application type:** Web Application

</dd>

5. On the **New Web App Integration** page, go to the general settings:

<dd>

  a. Add a name for your app in the **App integration name** field.

  b. Select **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token** from the options in the **Grant type** section.

  c. Add the **Redirect URL** copied from the OIDC configurations in Appsmith in the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field.

  d. Scroll down to the **Assignments** section and pick an option from **Controlled access** configure the Accessibility of this application as required.

  e. Click **Save**.

</dd>

6. On your new application, go to the **General** tab, and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to add them later in the OIDC configurations in Appsmith.

7. Open your account dropdown from the top-right corner of the navigation bar, and copy your **Okta domain** that is mentioned below your Email. 

<dd>

</dd>

8. Open your Okta domain URL in your browser, add `/.well-known/openid-configuration` to the end, like:

<dd>

```js
https://your-okta-domain.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

Copy the following URLs from the page:

  - **authorization_endpoint**

  - **token_endpoint**

  - **userinfo_endpoint**

  - **jwks_uri**


</dd>




##  Register Okta in Appsmith

To complete the OIDC configuration, you have to register the identity provider on Appsmith. Go to **Admin Settings > Authentication > OIDC**, and follow the steps below:

1. Add the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** copied from the Okta application into the respective fields.

2. Add the URLs copied from the `<your-okta-domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration` page into OIDC configurations in Appsmith as per the table below:

<dd>


  | **OIDC configuration field**       | **Okta URL**  |
  | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
  | **Authorization URL** | authorization_endpoint     |
  | **Token URL**         | token_endpoint             |
  | **User Info URL**      | userinfo_endpoint         |
  | **JWK Set URL**             |  jwks_uri          |

</dd>


3. In the **Scope** box, specify the scopes to be used by the application during authentication to authorize access to a user's details. By default, there are three scopes - `openid`, `email`, and `profile`. 
 
 <dd>

  Appsmith needs `openid` and `email` as mandatory scopes. Itâ€™s also highly recommended to use the `offline_access` scope to avoid errors related to expired access tokens and excessive re-login requests. For more information, see [Okta API scopes](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#scopes).

</dd>



4. In the **Username Attribute** box, specify the name of the claim which represents the email of the user. The default value is `email`.

5. Once you have added the details, click the **SAVE & RESTART** button to save the configuration and restart the instance. 

:::info
If you're running Appsmith on a **Kubernetes** cluster with an HA configuration, after completing the setup, run the following command to ensure the new authentication settings are properly applied:

```js
kubectl rollout restart deployment/appsmith -n
```
:::

After the Appsmith instance restarts, try logging in again to your account. You'll see a login screen with the **SIGN IN WITH OIDC SSO** button.
