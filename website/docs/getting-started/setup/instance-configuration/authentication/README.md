# Authentication

This section covers different authentication methods available on Appsmith. The default form login allows users to sign in using their email address and password. Besides, you can authorize users into Appsmith apps using **Google OAuth**, **GitHub OAuth** and popular SSO authentication protocols like **SAML**(enterprise version) and **OpenID Connect**(enterprise version).

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** is a session and user authentication service that permits users to use one set of login credentials. For example, you can use a single ID(email) to log in to any related or independent software applications. SSO lets you get your users securely into your apps, using an authentication system they're already using and trust. You can configure SSO in Appsmith to use custom authentication.
