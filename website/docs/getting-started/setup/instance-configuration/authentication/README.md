# Authentication

This section covers different authentication methods available on Appsmith. The default form login allows users to sign in using their email address and password. Besides, you can authorize users into Appsmith apps using **Google OAuth**, **GitHub OAuth** and popular SSO authentication protocols like **SAML**(enterprise version) and **OpenID Connect**(enterprise version).

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** is a convenient and secure way for users to access multiple applications with just one set of login credentials. This eliminates the need for users to remember multiple usernames and passwords, and also increases security by reducing the risk of password reuse. In Appsmith, SSO can be configured to use custom authentication methods, allowing users to securely access your apps using an authentication system they're already familiar with. For example, if a user logs into their email account using their SSO credentials, they can also be able to access other related systems such as the company's internal HR system, or a project management tool, without having to enter their login information again. This can save time and increase security by reducing the risk of forgotten passwords and phishing attacks.

In Appsmith, you have the option to configure Single Sign-On (SSO) using custom authentication methods. This allows you to integrate with the authentication system your users are already familiar with, providing a more seamless and secure login experience. Below is a list of available SSO integrations that can be configured in Appsmith:
