# Configure Instance

This page provides instructions on how to configure your self-hosted Appsmith instance. You can configure a self-hosted Appsmith instance by choosing any one of the below options:
* [Admin Settings](#admin-settings) 
* [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)

## Admin settings

The Admin Settings page allows [superusers](#add-super-admins) on self-hosted instances to manage various instance configurations, including email, authentication, and Google Maps integration, as well as user settings and permissions.

:::info
If you don’t see the “Admin Settings” option on the left sidebar, you’re not a super admin for the Appsmith instance and must be granted admin privileges by an existing super admin.

        lazyLoad="true"
/>


:::info
If you have set values using [environment variables](#environment-variables) for your instance, those values take precedence over values specified in the Admin Settings UI.

### Add super admins
Users who are granted super admin privileges are authorized to access and make changes to instance & platform settings. If you are a super admin and want to grant super admin privileges to other users, add their email addresses in the **Admin Email** field on the **General** settings page so they can access and modify instance settings as shown below:

### Configure instance
The Admin settings enable the configuration of various settings such as user authentication, email notifications, integrations, and more using the user interface for your self-hosted Appsmith instance.

## Environment variables
You may also choose to configure your self-hosted Appsmith instance using environment variables. Follow the instructions below for manually updating the configuration file for your installation type.

### Configure Docker installations

To configure a docker installation, go to your installation folder and edit the `stacks/configuration/docker.env` file with the environment variables for the service. For example, you wish to add the Google Maps API key. Add/update the environment variable `APPSMITH_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` and add the Google API key to it as shown below:

```bash
APPSMITH_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

After making changes, be sure to **restart the docker containers** for the changes to take effect. Run the below command to restart the Appsmith container.

* Docker run
  ```bash
   docker restart appsmith
  ```
* Docker Compose
  ```bash
   docker-compose restart appsmith
  ```

### Configure Helm installations

You can modify your Appsmith installation on Kubernetes using a `values.yaml` file. Follow these steps to update the values:

<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
<TabItem label="Community Edition" value="communityEdition"> 

1. Go to the root directory of your installation.

2. Generate the `values.yaml` file with:

  ```bash
  helm show values appsmith/appsmith > values.yaml
  ```  

3. Modify the parameter values in the `values.yaml` file available under the `applicationConfig` section. For example, if you want to change the email address from which your messages are sent, as shown below:

  ```yaml
  applicationConfig:
    #highlight-next-line
    APPSMITH_MAIL_FROM:"test@test.com"
  ```

4. Update the values with:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade appsmith appsmith/appsmith -f values.yaml -n appsmith
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Commercial Edition" value="commercialEdition"> 

1. Go to the root directory of your installation.

2. Generate the `values.yaml` file with:

  ```bash
  helm show values appsmith-ee/appsmith > values.yaml
  ```  

3. Modify the parameter values in the `values.yaml` file available under the `applicationConfig` section. For example, if you want to change the email address from which your messages are sent, as shown below:

  ```yaml
  applicationConfig:
    #highlight-next-line
    APPSMITH_MAIL_FROM:"test@test.com"
  ```

4. Update the values with:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade appsmith appsmith-ee/appsmith -f values.yaml -n appsmith
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs> 


### Configure ECS installations

To configure an ECS installation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the ECS console and select Task Definitions on the sidebar.
2. Click the Task Definition used by your ECS instance, and hit Create new revision.
3. On the `Task Definition config` page, click the Appsmith container definition to edit it. In the Environment Section, enter the environment configuration as key-value pairs, as shown below.

![](/img/ecs-task-env_(1).png)

It's recommended to use AWS Secrets for sensitive information. Follow these steps to [create a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html). Use the ARN of the secret as the Environment value and set the option to ValueFrom.

1. Hit the Update button, and hit Create to make a new task definition.
2. Navigate back to the ECS console and select your cluster. Click your service to open the service details.
3. Click Update, and select the latest revision of the Task Definition.
4. Hit Skip to review and then Update Service. The screen below shows the status.
