# Instance Configuration

:::note
If you don’t see the “Admin Settings” option on the left sidebar, you’re not a super admin for the Appsmith instance and must be granted admin privileges by an existing super admin.
:::


## Add super admins
Users who are granted super admin privileges are authorized to access and make changes to instance & platform settings. If you are a super admin and want to grant super admin privileges to other users, add their email addresses in the **Admin Email** field on the **General** settings page so they can access and modify instance settings as shown below:

* **Instance Name:** Instance Name lets you to modify the name to your self-hosted instance.

* **Admin Email:** This setting lets you specify the email addresses of the users to make them super administrators of your instance.

* **Generated Docker Compose File:** You can generate the Docker Compose file which defines services for your Appsmith instance. 

* **Share anonymous usage data**: : This setting lets you choose whether to share [anonymous usage data](/product/telemetry#opt-in-telemetry) with Appsmith to help improve the product.

* **Appsmith Watermark**: You can [upgrade](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing) your plan to remove the Build on Appsmith badge on the app's bottom right corner.

### Email

### Authentication
By default, users can sign in to the Appsmith app using their email address and password through the Form Login. Additionally, Appsmith supports [**Google OAuth**](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/authentication/google-login), [**GitHub OAuth**](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/authentication/github-login), as well as popular single sign-on (SSO) authentication protocols available on the enterprise edition such as [**SAML**](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/authentication/security-assertion-markup-language-saml)  and [**OpenID Connect**](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/authentication/openid-connect-oidc).


### Advanced settings
The Advanced Settings section allows you to configure additional settings for your Appsmith instance, including external Mongo database, Redis session storage, and custom domain setup.

* **MongoDB URI**: Appsmith utilizes MongoDB as its internal database. If you would like to use an [external MongoDB](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/custom-mongodb-redis) for clustering purposes, you can change the MongoDB URI to point to the external database.

* **Redis URL**: Appsmith uses Redis for session storage. If you want to use an [external Redis](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/custom-mongodb-redis) instance for clustering purposes, update the Redis URL to point to the external Redis instance.

* **Custom Domain**: You have the option to [set up a custom domain](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/custom-domain) for your Appsmith instance. 



### Branding

Appsmith's custom branding feature is exclusive to self-hosted, [Business Edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing) instances. It enables app builders to personalize their workspace and apps with their own logo and color palette for a cohesive experience. This includes the login screen, invite emails, and error pages to match the company's branding for end-users. To customize the appearance of your apps, see [Branding](/advanced-concepts/branding).



### Access control

Access control is a feature exclusive to Appsmith's Business Edition users that implements RBAC by assigning specific permissions to different user roles. The permission mapping for each role determines the actions they can take on the platform. To learn more about this feature, see [Access Control Guide](/advanced-concepts/access-control).

### Audit logs
The audit log feature in Appsmith is only available to Business Edition users and provides a record of all significant activities on the platform. It captures events such as what action was taken, who performed it, and when it occurred. Learn more about [Audit Logs](/advanced-concepts/audit-logs)


## Configure Docker installations

To configure a docker installation, go to your installation folder and edit the `stacks/configuration/docker.env` file with the environment variables for the service. For example, you wish to add Google Maps API key. Add/update the environment variable `APPSMITH_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` and add the Google API key to it as shown below:

```bash
APPSMITH_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

After making changes, be sure to **restart the docker containers** for the changes to take effect. Run the below command to restart the Appsmith container.

* Docker run
  ```bash
   docker restart appsmith
  ```
* Docker Compose
  ```bash
   docker-compose restart appsmith
  ```

## Configure Helm installations

To configure environment variables using helm, follow these steps:

<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions">
  <TabItem label="Community Edition" value="communityEdition"> 

  You may choose to configure environment variables: through commands or by using a `values.yaml` file.

  * When using command, specify each parameter using `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to helm upgrade.

  ```bash
    helm upgrade --set applicationConfig.<ENV_KEY>=<ENV_VALUE> [ RELEASE ] [ CHART ]  
  ```
  For example, the below command sets the `APPSMITH_SIGNUP_DISABLED` variable to `true` and configures it to disable signup button on Appsmith login screen. 

  * Alternatively, use a `values.yaml` file. You can specify the parameter values in the `applicationConfig` section. 

  ```yaml
    APPSMITH_OAUTH2_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: ""
    APPSMITH_OAUTH2_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: ""
    APPSMITH_OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: ""
    APPSMITH_OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET: ""
    APPSMITH_FORM_LOGIN_DISABLED: ""
    APPSMITH_SIGNUP_DISABLED: "true"
  ``` 
Once you have made changes to the values file, run the below command.

```bash
  helm upgrade --values values.yaml appsmith appsmith/appsmith
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Business Edition" value="businessEdition"> 

   You may choose to configure environment variables: through commands or by using a `values.yaml` file.

  * When using command, specify each parameter using `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to helm upgrade.

  ```bash
    helm upgrade --set applicationConfig.<ENV_KEY>=<ENV_VALUE> [ RELEASE ] [ CHART ]  
  ```
  For example, the below command sets the `APPSMITH_SIGNUP_DISABLED` variable to `true` and configures it to disable signup button on Appsmith login screen. 

  * Alternatively, use a `values.yaml` file. You can specify the parameter values in the `applicationConfig` section. 

  ```yaml
    APPSMITH_OAUTH2_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: ""
    APPSMITH_OAUTH2_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: ""
    APPSMITH_OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: ""
    APPSMITH_OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET: ""
    APPSMITH_FORM_LOGIN_DISABLED: ""
    APPSMITH_SIGNUP_DISABLED: "true"
  ```
Once you have made changes to the values file, run the below command.

```bash
  helm upgrade --values values.yaml appsmith appsmith-ee/appsmith
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 

## Configure ECS installations

To configure an ECS installation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the ECS console and select Task Definitions on the sidebar.
2. Click on the Task Definition used by your ECS instance, and hit Create new revision.
3. On the `Task Definition config` page, click the Appsmith container definition to edit it. In the Environment Section, enter the environment configuration as key-value pairs as shown below.

![](/img/ecs-task-env_(1).png)

It's recommended to use AWS Secrets for sensitive information, please follow the steps to [create a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html). Use the ARN of the secret as the Environment value and set the option to ValueFrom.

1. Hit the Update button, and hit Create to make a new task definition.
2. Navigate back to the ECS console and select your cluster. Click on your service to open the service details.
3. Click on Update, and select the latest revision of the Task Definition.
4. Hit Skip to review and then Update Service. A screen as below shows the status.
