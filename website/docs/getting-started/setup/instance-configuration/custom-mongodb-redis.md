# Custom MongoDB & Redis

Appsmith runs it's own instances of MongoDB database for storing all application data, and Redis for storing session information. It's easy to switch to externally running instances of these services, by just changing the relevant environment variables.

:::info Important
If you are currently using an older version of MongoDB, it's important to upgrade to version 5.0 before connecting Appsmith to an external MongoDB instance. For more information, follow the steps detailed on MongoDB official documentation to [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/).
:::

## Custom MongoDB

To point to a custom MongoDB, update the `env` variable called `APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI` to point to your custom MongoDB server. For example, if you are using [MongoDB Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud), you can change this to something like the following:

```bash
APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@mongo.host.name/databasename
```

The exact URI to be set here can be obtained from MongoDB Cloud's web interface.

:::note Important
* To use an external MongoDB database with Appsmith, `replicaSet` needs to be configured on the database. This can be done by connecting to the database as `admin`, and running [`rs.initiate()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.initiate/). If you are using MongoDB Cloud, this is always done for you.
* Ensure that the credentials used to connect to MongoDB should have the `readWrite` and `clusterMonitor` roles assigned.
* In a multi-node configuration of MongoDB cluster, the `readPreference=primary` URL parameter needs to be added to the MongoDB connection string. For example, `mongodb://localhost:27017/appsmith?authSource=admin&replicaSet=rs0&readPreference=primary`. This is required to support transactional operations in MongoDB.

## Custom Redis

To use a custom Redis with Appsmith, please change the `env` variable `APPSMITH_REDIS_URL`. For example,

```bash
APPSMITH_REDIS_URL=redis://hostname:6379
```

## Applying changes

Please remember to [**restart the Appsmith instance**](./) to apply the changes.
