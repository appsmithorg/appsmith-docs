# Upgrade from Community Appsmith (Docker)

The page provides steps to upgrade the Appsmith Docker Community Edition.

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading, ensure you have:

- Signed up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com/) and generated a trial license key.
- At least 2 GB of free storage space for the backup process.
- Deployed the latest version of Appsmith. Refer to [Upgrade Appsmith Versions](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/update-appsmith#update-on-docker) to update the version.
- Created a backup of your Appsmith instance. For instructions, see [Backup instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/backup-and-restore/backup-instance).

## Upgrade Appsmith instance

Follow these steps to upgrade your Appsmith instance:

1. Go to the root directory of Appsmith installation.
2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file, and search for the `image:` key.
3. Update the value of the `image:` key as below:

  ``` yaml
    services:
      appsmith:
      #highlight-next-line
        image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
  ```
4. Save the file.

5. Recreate the instance with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
  ```

6. Open [https://localhost](https://localhost) and wait for the server to come up. This can take up to 5 minutes. Once the server is up and running, verify the upgrade with:

  ```bash
  # verify the image name as (appsmith-ee) in use 
  docker ps
  ```
You have successfully upgraded your Docker Appsmith instance. 

7.  Log into your Appsmith account.

## Troubleshooting

If you face issues during the upgrade, rollback to the backup created in [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section by following the [Restore instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/backup-and-restore/restore-instance) guide, and contact the support team using the chat widget at the bottom right of this page.
