# Downgrade to Free Plan

This page provides step-by-step instructions to downgrade your paid plan to a free plan in Appsmith.

## Before you begin

Downgrading your plan will result in the loss of access to one or more paid features, which may result in some features and capabilities not being available. Before beginning the downgrade process, read about [what happens when you downgrade your plan](/getting-started/setup/manage-plans/downgrade-plan).

## Prerequisites

* You can access **Admin Settings** on the Appsmith instance.

## Remove license key

To downgrade to a free plan, you have to remove your license key in your Appsmith instance. Follow these steps to remove your license key:

1. Go to **Admin Settings** â†’ **License & Plans**.
2. Click the **Remove** button.
3. You will see a confirmation box. Confirm the plan change by clicking the **Confirm** button.

The confirmation initiates the process, and your account moves to a free plan.
