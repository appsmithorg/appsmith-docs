This page provides step-by-step instructions to downgrade your Business plan in Appsmith.

## Before you begin

Downgrading your plan will result in the loss of access to one or more paid features, which may result in some features and capabilities not being available. Before beginning the downgrade process, read about [what happens when you downgrade or to a lower tier plan](/getting-started/setup/manage-plans/downgrade-plan).

## Prerequisites
