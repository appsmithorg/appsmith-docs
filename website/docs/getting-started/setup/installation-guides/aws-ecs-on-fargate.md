# AWS ECS on Fargate

This page provides steps to install Appsmith using AWS ECS on Fargate.

## Prerequisites

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. If you don't have one, [Create an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
* Switch to the Classic Amazon Web Console.
* If you already have an Application Load Balancer (ALB), ensure that you have listeners set up for ports 80 and 443. If you don't have one, provision an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html).
* An Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) set up. If you don't have an Amazon EFS, create by following the below steps:
    - Go to **AWS EFS** in the Amazon Management Console and click **Create**.
    - Configure parameters for VPC and storage class. 
    - Verify that the EFS, ECS cluster and Fargate instances are in the same VPC.
    - Go to the Network tab for the ECS that you created, and ensure the mount-target is available in the same availability zone as the ECS cluster.
    - An Amazon Security group with ports 80, 443, and 22 accessible. If you don't have one, [Create a Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group)
    - To enable port access, [add an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule) for the port ranges 80, 443, and 22 to the security group you created above.
    - Attach the security group to the EFS mount target.
* An ECS Task Role set up. If you don't have a task role, create by following the below steps:
    - Go to the **IAM** console and select **Roles**.
    - Click **Create Role**.
    - Select **AWS Service** as the trusted entity type.
    - Choose **Elastic Container Service Task** as the use case.
    - Add permissions, including `SecretsManagerReadWrite`.
    - Give a meaningful name to the role and ensure it has a trust policy for `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com` with the `sts:AssumeRole` permission.
* An external MongoDB instance hosting a MongoDB V5.0 or later, and credentials to access data. You will not be able to use the built-in MongoDB with EFS as it causes the Appsmith instance to crash.

## Install Appsmith
Follow the below steps to install Appsmith:

### Create ECS cluster

1. Go to Classic Amazon Web Console and click **Clusters** on the sidebar, and click **Create Cluster**.

    <figcaption align="center"><i>Create Cluster using Classic Amazon Web Console</i></figcaption>
 </figure>

2. Choose **Networking only** as the cluster template and click the **Next step** button.
3. Give a desired name to the **Cluster name** field.
4. Select the VPC that you created in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
5. Scroll down to the **CloudWatch Container Insights** section, and tick the **Enable container insights** checkbox.
6. Click the **Create** button. You will see a launch status screen as shown below:

    <figcaption align="center"><i>A launch status screen shows the ECS Cluster status</i></figcaption>
 </figure>

7. Click the **View cluster** button to see your cluster.

### Create task and container definitions

Follow these steps to create task and container definitions for your cluster:

1. Click **Task Definitions** from the sidebar, and click **Create new Task Definition**.
2. Select **Fargate** as launch type compatibility, and click the **Next step** button.
3. Give a desired name to **Task definition Name**.
4. Select the **Task role** that you created in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
5. Select the default Network mode.
6. Set Linux as the Operating system family.
7. Select the **Create new role** option for **Task Execution Role**.
8. Set the required task size for memory & CPU (you need at least 2vCPU and 4 GB Memory).
9. Go to the **Volumes** section and add a new volume as shown below:
    * **Name** - Give a desired name.
    * **Volume type** - EFS.
    * **File System ID** - EFS file system created in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. 
    * Keep the default values for the remaining fields.
10. Configure the Appsmith container.
    1. Click the **Add container** button.
    2. Enter the container name, and set the Image to `appsmith/appsmith-ce`.
    3. Scroll down to the **Port mappings** section.
    4. Add port mappings for ports 80 and 443.
    4. Set the _Mount points Source volume_ to `appsmith_stack` and set the Container path to `/appsmith-stacks`.
11. You can configure the environment values for the Appsmith in the Environment Section. For sensitive values, it's **recommended** that you create secrets and set the `env` value using the `ValueFrom` option by specifying the `arn` of the secret created.
12. Set the following Environment Variables:
    - `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`: Add a password to encrypt all credentials in the database.
    - `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT`: Use encryption salt to encrypt all credentials in the database.
    - `APPSMITH_SUPERVISOR_PASSWORD` : Password to access the supervisor console to watch the processes in the Appsmith container.
    - `APPSMITH_MONGODB_URI` : Enter the URI of the external MongoDB (v5.0 or later) instance.
    - `APPSMITH_ENABLE_EMBEDDED_DB` to `0`. This disables embedded mock databases which are not supported on EFS volume.
13. Configure the health check to the following settings:
    - Command: `CMD-SHELL, curl http://localhost/api/v1/health`
    - Interval: 10 seconds
    - Timeout : 5 seconds
    - Start periods: 160 seconds
    - Retries: 3
14. Check the **Auto-configure CloudWatch Logs** checkbox for **Log configuration**.
15. Click **Add** button.
16. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click the **Create** button.

### Create and run ECS service

Follow these steps to create and run an ECS service:

1.  Go to the cluster dashboard and click the name of the ECS cluster that you created in [Create ECS Cluster](#create-ecs-cluster).
2. On the cluster details, click **Create** button under the **Services** tab.
3. Configure the Service:
    * **Launch Type** - Select Fargate.
    * **Task Definition** - Select the task definition you created in [Create task and container definitions](#create-task-and-container-definitions) with the latest revision.
    * **Cluster** - Select the cluster you created in [Create ECS Cluster](#create-ecs-cluster).
    * **Service name** - Give a desired name.
    * **Service type** - Select Replica.
    * **Number of Tasks** - Set as 1.
    * For other attributes, move ahead with the default selection, and click the **Next step** button.
4. Configure the Network:
    * Select the VPC and the subnets.
    * Select the security group that you created in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section, and add the security group with NFS access.
    * Select the Application Load Balancer that you created in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
    * Set the listener for port 80 and click the **Add to the load balancer** button.
    * Create a new production listener port for port 80.
    * **Production listener protocol** - Set it to HTTP.
    * **Target Group** - Select **create new**.
    * Set the Health Check pattern to `/api/v1/health` and evaluation order to 1.
    * Repeat the same steps to add a listener for port 443 and protocol as HTTPS.
5. Keep the default selection for the **Auto Scaling** page and click the **Next step** button.
6. Review the details and click **Create Service**. You see a launch status screen as shown below:

    <figure>
    <img src="/img/aws_ecs_ec2_create_ecs_service_status.png" style={{width: "100%", height: "auto"}} alt="A launch status screen shows the ECS Service Status." />
    <figcaption align="center"><i>A launch status screen shows the ECS Service Status</i></figcaption>
    </figure>

7. Get the Domain Name or public IP of your ALB to access Appsmith.

## Connect to Fargate instance

1. Enable the `exec` on the Fargate instance with:

  ```bash
    aws ecs update-service --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME>  --service <SERVICE_NAME> --region <REGION> --enable-execute-command --force-new-deployment
  ``` 
The `exec` command will be available once the new deployment is active.

2. Exec into the Fargate Appsmith instance with:
    ```bash
    aws ecs execute-command <Cluster Name>
        --task <Task ID>\
        --container appsmith \
        --interactive \
        --command "bash"
    ```
3. Once you have access to the bash shell, you can execute all commands that are available in the Appsmith container, like [appsmithctl](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl).
