# AWS ECS on Fargate

This page provides steps to install Appsmith on AWS ECS using Fargate.

## Prerequisites

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) account** - If you don't have one, [Create an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - If you already have an ALB, follow these steps:
  - Provision an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html#configure-load-balancer), and ensure that port 80 and 443 are available to configure ECS service.
  - Add or create a security group with ports 80 and 443 accessible.
- **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** - If you haven't set up an EFS yet, follow these steps:
  :::danger
  Do not share the EFS across ECS services, as doing so will cause Appsmith services to crash.
  :::
  - Go to **AWS EFS** and click the **Create file system** button.
  - Give a meaningful name to your file system and configure VPC.
  - Refresh the file system listing, and select the file system you created above.
  - Go to the **Network** tab, and click **Manage** button on the right side.
  - Select the security group with port `2049` accessible. If you don't have one:
    - [Create a Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group)
    - To enable port access, [add an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule) for the port `2049` for NFS access to the security group you created above.
    - Attach the security group to the EFS mount target.
- **ECS Exec Policy** - Set up a policy to allow ECS Exec capability by following these steps:

  - Go to the **IAM** console and select **Policies**.
  - Click **Create Policy**.
  - On **Specify Permissions** screen, choose JSON for policy editor, and update the policy with the below details:

    ```javascript
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel",
                    "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
                    "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
                    "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
            ]
    }
    ```

  * Click the **Next** button.
  * On **Review and Create** screen, give a meaningful name to your policy and click the **Create Policy** button. The new policy will be available in the list of policies.

- **ECS Task Role** - Set up an ECS Task Role by following the below steps:
  - Go to the **IAM** console and select **Roles**
  - Click the **Create Role**.
  - On the **Name, review, and create** screen, give a meaningful name to the role.
  - Select the trusted entity type.
  - Choose **Elastic Container Service** as **Service or use case**.
  - Select **Elastic Container Service Task** for **Use case**.
  - On the **Add permissions** screen, search the policy name you created above and add it to the role. Similarly, search for the `SecretsManagerReadWrite` policy and add it to the role.
- **External MongoDB Instance** - Ensure you can access an external MongoDB instance hosting MongoDB V5.0 or later. You will not be able to use the built-in MongoDB with EFS as it will cause the Appsmith instance to crash.

## Install Appsmith

Follow the below steps to install Appsmith:

### Create ECS cluster

1. Go to Classic Amazon Web Console and click **Clusters** on the sidebar, and click **Create Cluster**.

If you want to generate a license key, sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com) to create one, and then proceed to activate your instance using the newly generated license key.

## Connect to Fargate instance

1. Enable the `exec` on the Fargate instance with:

```bash
  aws ecs update-service --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME>  --service <SERVICE_NAME> --region <REGION> --enable-execute-command --force-new-deployment
```

The `exec` command will be available once the new deployment is active. 

2. Exec into the Fargate Appsmith instance with:
`bash
    aws ecs execute-command --cluster <Cluster Name>
    --task <Task ID> \
    --container appsmith \
    --interactive \
    --command "bash"
    ` 

3. Once you can access the bash shell, you can execute all commands available in the Appsmith container, like [appsmithctl](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl).

## Install Appsmith Community

To install the Appsmith open source edition (Appsmith Community), replace `appsmith-ee` with `appsmith-ce` in step 10 of the [Install Appsmith](#install-appsmith) section on this page.

## Troubleshooting

If you are facing issues during deployment, please refer to the guide on [troubleshooting deployment errors](/help-and-support/troubleshooting-guide/deployment-errors).
