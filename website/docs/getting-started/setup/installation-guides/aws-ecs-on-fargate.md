# AWS ECS on Fargate

This page provides steps to install Appsmith on AWS ECS using Fargate.

## Prerequisites

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) account** - If you don't have one, [Create an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - If you already have an ALB, make sure you have listeners set up for ports 80 and 443. Otherwise, provision an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html#configure-load-balancer).
* **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** - If you haven't set up an EFS yet, follow these steps:
    - Go to **AWS EFS** in the Amazon Management Console and click the **Create file system** button.
    - Give a meaningful name to your file system and configure VPC. 
    - Refresh the file system listing, and select the file system you created above.
    - Go to the **Network** tab, and click **Manage** button on the right side.
    - Select the Amazon Security group with port 2049 accessible. If you don't have one:
        - [Create a Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group)
        - To enable port access, [add an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule) for the port 2049 for NFS access to the security group you created above.
        - Attach the security group to the EFS mount target.
* **ECS Exec Policy** - Set up a policy to allow ECS Exec capability by following these steps:
    - Go to the **IAM** console and select **Policies**.
    - Click **Create Policy**.
    - On _Specify Permissions_ screen, choose JSON for policy editor, and update the policy with the below details:

        ```javascript
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel",
                        "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
                        "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
                        "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "*"
                }
                ]
        }
        ```
    - Click the **Next** button.
    - On _Review and Create_ screen, give a meaningful name to your policy and click the **Create Policy** button. The new policy will be available in the list of policies.
* **ECS Task Role** - Set up an ECS Task Role by following the below steps:
    - Go to the **IAM** console and select **Roles** 
    - Click the **Create Role**.
    - On the _Name, review, and create_ screen, give a meaningful name to the role.
    - Select the trusted entity type.
    - Choose **Elastic Container Service** as _Service or use case_.
    - Select **Elastic Container Service Task** for _Use case_.
    - On the _Add permissions_ screen, search the policy name you created above and add it to the role. Similarly, search for the `SecretsManagerReadWrite` policy and add it to the role.
    
* **External MongoDB Instance** - Ensure you can access an external MongoDB instance hosting MongoDB V5.0 or later. You will not be able to use the built-in MongoDB with EFS as it will cause the Appsmith instance to crash.

## Install Appsmith

## Connect to Fargate instance

1. Enable the `exec` on the Fargate instance with:

  ```bash
    aws ecs update-service --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME>  --service <SERVICE_NAME> --region <REGION> --enable-execute-command --force-new-deployment
  ``` 
The `exec` command will be available once the new deployment is active.

2. Exec into the Fargate Appsmith instance with:
    ```bash
    aws ecs execute-command <Cluster Name>
        --task <Task ID>\
        --container appsmith \
        --interactive \
        --command "bash"
    ```
3. Once you can access the bash shell, you can execute all commands  available in the Appsmith container, like [appsmithctl](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl).
