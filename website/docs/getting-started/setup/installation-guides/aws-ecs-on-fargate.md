# AWS ECS on Fargate

This page provides steps to install Appsmith on AWS ECS using Fargate.

## Prerequisites

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. If you don't have one, [Create an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
* An Amazon EC2 key pair. If you don't have one, [Generate an SSH Key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair).
* An Application Load Balancer (ALB) - If you already have an ALB, follow these steps:
  * Provision an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html#configure-load-balancer), and ensure that port 80 and 443 are available to configure ECS service.
  * Add an Amazon Security group with ports 80, and 443 accessible. If you don't have one, [Create a Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group). 
* You will not be able to use the built-in MongoDB with EFS as it will cause the Appsmith instance to crash. Hence, ensure you have set up and can access an external MongoDB instance hosting MongoDB V5.0 or later. For more information, see [External MongoDB](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/custom-mongodb-redis#external-mongodb).


## Create EFS volume

Follow these steps to create an Elastic File System (EFS):

 :::danger
  Do not share the Elastic File System (EFS) across ECS services, as doing so will cause Appsmith services to crash.
  :::

1. Navigate to the **Elastic File System** section of the AWS Management Console and click the **Create file system** button.
2. Provide a meaningful name to your file system, configure the VPC settings as required, and click **Create**.
3. Select the file system you created above from the list and switch to the **Network** tab.
4. Click the **Manage** button, and assign the security group that allows NFS access on port 2049. If you don't have such a security group:
    * Follow the [Create a Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group) guide and include an inbound rule for NFS access on port 2049. 
    * Enable the port access by [adding an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule) for the port `2049` for NFS access to the security group you created above.
    * To allow outbound traffic, add an outbound rule to permit all traffic. If you need specific restrictions, customize the outbound rules according to your requirements.
    * Once created, attach this security group to your EFS.

## Set up ECS Exec policy

 Follow the below steps to set up a policy to allow ECS Exec capability:

1. Go to the **IAM** console and select **Policies**, and click the **Create Policy** button.
2. Choose **JSON** for the policy editor, and update the policy with the below details:

    ```javascript
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel",
                    "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
                    "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
                    "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
            ]
    }
    ```
3. Click the **Next** button.
4. On the **Review and Create** screen, give a meaningful name to your policy and click the **Create Policy** button. Your policy is available in the list of policies.

## Create ECS task role

Follow these steps to set up an ECS Task Role:

1. Go to the **IAM** console, select **Roles**, and click the **Create Role** button.
2. **Trusted entity type** - Select **AWS service**.
3. **Use case** - Choose **Elastic Container Service**.
4. In the **Choose a use case for specified service** setting, select **Elastic Container Service Task** for **Use case**.
5. Click the **Next** button.
6. On the **Add permissions** screen, search the policy name you created in the [Set up ECS Exec policy](#set-up-ecs-exec-policy) section. Similarly, search for the `SecretsManagerReadWrite` policy and add it to the role.
7. On the **Name, review, and create** screen, give a meaningful name to the role, and click the **Create Role** button to create the role.

<ZoomImage src="/img/aws-ecs-ami-find-DNS-to-access-appsmith.png" alt="Use DNS or Public IP to access Appsmith." caption="Use Public IP to access Appsmith" />
4. Fill in your details to create an administrator account.
5. Once you've created an account, you can either start with the free plan or activate your instance with a license key. If you want to generate a license key, sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com) to create one, and then proceed to activate your instance using the newly generated license key.


## Connect to Fargate instance

1. Enable the `exec` on the Fargate instance with:
    ```bash
        aws ecs update-service --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME>  --service <SERVICE_NAME> --region <REGION> --enable-execute-command --force-new-deployment
    ```
    The `exec` command will be available once the new deployment is active. 

2. Exec into the Fargate Appsmith instance with:
    ```bash
    aws ecs execute-command --cluster <Cluster Name>
    --task <Task ID> \
    --container appsmith \
    --interactive \
    --command "bash"
    ``` 

3. Once you can access the bash shell, you can execute all commands available in the Appsmith container, like [appsmithctl](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl).

## Install Appsmith Community

To install the Appsmith open source edition (Appsmith Community), replace `appsmith-ee` with `appsmith-ce` in step 4 of the [Create task and container definitions](#create-task-and-container-definitions) section on this page.
