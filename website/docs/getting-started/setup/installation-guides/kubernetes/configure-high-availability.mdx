# Configure High Availability and Scalability
The high availability and scalability features of Kubernetes ensure continuous access to your applications. This page shows how to set up high availability and scalability for Appsmith.

:::info
High Availability is only available on Kubernetes self-hosted [**Business Edition**](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing) instances of Appsmith.
:::

## Prerequisites

1. A self-hosted Kubernetes Business Edition Appsmith installation. If not installed yet, see the [Kubernetes installation guide](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/kubernetes) for installing Appsmith.
2. A running Kubernetes cluster with more than one node to achieve high availability. 
3. At least 2 GB of free storage space for backup and update tasks.

## Before you begin
1. Create a backup of the Appsmith instance, See [Backup instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl?current-command-type=kubernetes-commands#backup-instance) guide.
2. Install a metrics server that provides vital metrics to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the pods with:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
  ```
3. Configure your Kubernetes cluster with Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and set up the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC),follow these steps:

    a. To create an IAM role to interact with the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), see [Creating an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html#efs-create-iam-resources) guide.
          
    b. Amazon EFS Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is a plugin for Kubernetes that allows you to mount Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) on your Kubernetes pods. To install the Amazon EFS CSI driver, see [Installing the Amazon EFS CSI driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/blob/master/docs/README.md#installation) guide. 

    c. To create the EFS file system, see [Create an Amazon EFS file system for Amazon EKS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/blob/master/docs/efs-create-filesystem.md) guide.

    d. To configured the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for the Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

      *  **Create a New Persistent Volume Claim** - Create a new PVC and update the `values.yaml` file as shown below:

        ```yaml
            existingClaim:
              enabled: false
              name: 
              claimName: 
            efs:
              # highlight-next-line
              enabled: true
              driver: efs.csi.aws.com
              # highlight-next-line
              volumeHandle: FILE_SYSTEM_ID
        ```
        *  **Reuse an Existing Persistent Volume Claim** - If you already have a PVC that you want to reuse for EFS or if you have multiple deployments/pods needing access to the same EFS volume, update the `values.yaml` file as shown below:

          ```yaml
            existingClaim:
                # highlight-next-line
                enabled: true
                name: efsappsmith
                claimName: efsappsmith
              efs:
                enabled: true
                # highlight-next-line
                driver: efs.csi.aws.com
                # highlight-next-line
                volumeHandle: FILE_SYSTEM_ID
          ```
      

## Configure instance

1. Go to the Appsmith installation directory, open `values.yaml` file, and turn on autoscaling by changing the `enabled` attribute to `true` for autoscaling attribute.

  ```yaml
  autoscaling:
    # highlight-next-line
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 2
    maxReplicas: 2
  ```

2. Update the Appsmith installation with high availability configuration with: 

  ```bash
  helm upgrade -i appsmith-ee appsmith-ee/appsmith -n appsmith-ee -f values.yaml
  ``` 
 If the `values.yaml` file is not in the deployment directory specify the file location in the `-f` attribute.

3. Verify the pod status with:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n appsmith-ee
  ```
The above command displays the status of the pods. Once the process is completed, the pod status is shown as _RUNNING_.

## Troubleshooting
If you see errors, you can roll back to a previous version to fix the issue. For more information, see the [Restore instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl?current-command-type=kubernetes-commands#restore-instance) section.
