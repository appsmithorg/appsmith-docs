1. Click to download the docker-compose.yml(Create_a_new_Bitly_Link) file and place it into the Appsmith installation folder. Or, run the following cURL:

```bash
curl -L <ADD_NEW_BITLY_LINK_TO_DOWNLOAD -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
```

2. Start the Docker container by running the command below. This may need to be run with `sudo` if docker and docker-compose aren't accessible by the user. If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The Appsmith server should be up and running soon. Once the Appsmith container is ready, the message `Appsmith is Running!` is displayed in the Docker logs. You can follow the logs with the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f appsmith
```
This message is also logged and available in server logs in `stacks/logs/backend/backend.log`.

3. After launching Appsmith, create or sign in to your account. Upon successful login, a screen is shown where you can enter your license key or start a trial.
