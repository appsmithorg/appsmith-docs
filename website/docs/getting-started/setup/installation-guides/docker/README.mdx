# Docker

Docker is an open source [containerization](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/learn/containerization) platform. It enables developers to package applications into standardized executable components called containers. These containers combine the application's source code with the Operating System (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later) _(Recommended)_
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)

1. Create an installation folder called `appsmith` where you would like your Appsmith installation and data storage.
2. `cd` into the installation folder.

## Setup with docker compose

The Appsmith Docker image contains all the components required to run, within a single Docker container. All these multiple processes are managed by a [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) instance, which is a lightweight process manager.

1. Click to [download the `docker-compose.yml` file](/img/docker-compose_(3).yml), and place it into your Appsmith installation folder.

**OR,** run the following cURL:

```bash
curl -L https://bit.ly/3AQzII6 -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
```

2. Start the Docker container by running the command below. You may need to run with `sudo` if `docker` and `docker-compose` aren't accessible by your user. If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To upgrade your existing Community Edition installation to the Business Edition, [follow these instructions](/getting-started/setup/upgrade-to-business-edition/docker).
:::

1. Click to [download the `docker-compose.yml` file](/img/docker-compose_(3).yml), and place it into your Appsmith installation folder.

**OR,** run the following cURL:

```bash
curl -L https://bit.ly/3AQzII6 -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
```

2. Change the **image** name from `appsmith-ce` to `appsmith-ee` for the `image:` key in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Add your **license key** (`APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY`) to the `environment:` key in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. Start the Docker container by running the command below. You may need to run with `sudo` if `docker` and `docker-compose` aren't accessible by your user. If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Your Appsmith server should be up and running soon. You can access it at [http://localhost](http://localhost). You can also verify that it's working correctly in the [Docker logs](#docker-logs).

If this is your first time setting up using Docker, you should expect a welcome page similar to the one below.

### Updating Appsmith

To update Appsmith (configured with docker-compose) manually, go to the root directory of your installation and run the following command:

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && docker-compose up -d
```

### Enabling Appsmith auto-updates

Automatic updates are turned off by default in the docker-compose.yml file. To enable them, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the root directory of your Appsmith instance and run:

   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file with any text editor and un-comment all the lines that are commented out (lines 13-23).
3. Save the file and run:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

:::info
To complement automatic updates, Appsmith also has an auto-backup feature. Before an automatic update, Appsmith first creates a backup to ensure you can [roll back](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#restore-appsmith-instance) an update to a previous version of Appsmith if necessary. For this auto-backup to work, please ensure that there is a minimum of 2 GB of free storage; otherwise, both the backup and update tasks fail.
:::

This configuration runs an Appsmith instance and a Watchtower instance to keep Appsmith automatically up-to-date. Your installation is now configured to stay up-to-date automatically.

## Setup with Docker run

To get Appsmith up and running:

<Tabs groupId="editions">
   <TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community">

This command downloads the image and starts Appsmith:

```bash
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" --pull always appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Business Edition" value="business">

This command downloads the image and starts Appsmith:

```bash
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" -e APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> --pull always appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Updating Appsmith

   <TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community">

To update Appsmith manually, go to the root directory of your installation and run the following commands:

```bash
docker rmi appsmith/appsmith-ce -f
docker pull appsmith/appsmith-ce
docker rm -f appsmith
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Business Edition" value="business">

To update Appsmith manually, go to the root directory of your installation and run the following commands:

```bash
docker rmi appsmith/appsmith-ee -f
docker pull appsmith/appsmith-ee
docker rm -f appsmith
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" -e APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the download is complete, the server should be up in under a minute. You can verify that it's working correctly in the [Docker logs](#docker-logs).

## Docker logs

Once your Appsmith container is ready, you should see `Appsmith is Running!` in the Docker logs.

![Appsmith is running message](/img/InstallationGuides__Docker__AppsmithRunningMessage.png)

You can follow the logs with the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f appsmith
```

This message is also logged and available in server logs in (`stacks/logs/backend/backend.log`).

## Restarting containers

If your containers are failing to restart, you can [download and run the `restart-container.sh`](/img/restart-container.sh) script linked below to bring them up:

Copy the script (`restart-container.sh`) to your installation folder and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x restart-container.sh
./restart-container.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors during this process, follow the guide on [debugging deployment errors](/help-and-support/troubleshooting-guide/deployment-errors). If you are still facing issues, please contact [support@appsmith.com](mailto:support@appsmith.com) or join the Appsmith [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp) to speak to the Appsmith team directly.
