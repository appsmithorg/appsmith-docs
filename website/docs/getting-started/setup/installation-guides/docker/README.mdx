## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

1. To download the `docker-compose.yml` file, run the following cURL command:
```bash
curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
```
This command saves the file in the current directory.

2. Start the Docker container using the following command. You may need to run with `sudo` if you don't have permission to run `docker-compose`. 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

3. To confirm that the deployment is complete, run the command `docker logs -f appsmith`. When the deployment is complete, you can see the message 'Appsmith is Running!' in the logs. You can access it at [http://localhost](http://localhost).
