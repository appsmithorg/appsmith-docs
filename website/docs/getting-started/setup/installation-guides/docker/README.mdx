## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

## Install

Follow the steps below to install Appsmith using Docker Compose:

<Tabs groupId="editions" >
<TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community">

1. Create a folder named `appsmith` for deployment and data storage, then navigate to it using `cd` command.

2. There are two ways in which you can download the `docker-compose.yml` file:
   
* Download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE) file and place it into the Appsmith installation folder. 

* Or run the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
```
3. To start the Docker container, use the following command. You may have to run the command with `sudo` if you don't have permission to execute `docker-compose`. The below command downloads the Docker image if not present locally.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The server deploys Appsmith at startup, and you can access it at [http://localhost](http://localhost). You can also check the logs when deployment is in progress. Use the `docker logs -f appsmith` command to verify logs. After the deployment is complete, a message stating 'Appsmith is Running!' is displayed in the logs.
