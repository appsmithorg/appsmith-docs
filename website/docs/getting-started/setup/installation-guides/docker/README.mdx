## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

## Install Appsmith

Follow these steps to install Appsmith:

1. Create a folder named `appsmith` on your machine for deployment and data storage. Navigate to this folder using the `cd` command.

<a id="docker-compose-file"></a>

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `appsmith` folder:

   ```yaml title="docker-compose.yml" 
   version: "3"
   services:
      appsmith:
         image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
         container_name: appsmith
         ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
         volumes:
            - ./stacks:/appsmith-stacks
         restart: unless-stopped
   ```

3. Start the Docker container by using the below command. You may need to use `sudo` if you don't have permission to run `docker-compose`:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
This command will download the necessary Docker image if it doesn't exist locally and start the container.

4. Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) and wait for the server to come up. This can take up to 5 minutes. Once the server is up and running, you can access Appsmith at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

### Generate a trial license (Optional)

To explore [paid plans](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing), you may choose to generate a trial license key.
1. Sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com).
2. Generate a trial license key.

### Activate and use Appsmith

1. Log into your Appsmith account. 
2. If you have a license key, enter it to activate your instance to try the paid plan.
3. If you don't have a license key, you can continue to use Appsmith under a free plan.

## Install Appsmith Community

To install Appsmith Community, replace `ee` with `ce` in the [docker-compose.yml](#docker-compose-file) file on this page.
