## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

## Install Appsmith

Follow these steps to install Appsmith:

1. Create a folder named `appsmith` on your machine for deployment and data storage. Navigate to this folder using the `cd` command.

<a id="docker-compose-file"></a>

2. Run the below command to download `docker-compose.yml` file in the `appsmith` folder:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-be -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Start the Docker container by using the below command. You may need to use `sudo` if you don't have permission to run `docker-compose`:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
This command will download the necessary Docker image if it doesn't exist locally and start the container.

4. Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) and wait for the server to come up. This can take up to 5 minutes. Once the server is up and running, you can access Appsmith at [http://localhost](http://localhost). 

5. Fill in your details to create an administrator account.

6. Once you've created an account, you can either start with the free plan or activate your instance with a license key. If you want to generate a license key, sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com) to create one, and then proceed to activate your instance using the newly generated license key.

## Install Appsmith Community

To install the Appsmith open source edition (Appsmith Community), replace `appsmith-ee` with `appsmith-ce` in the [docker-compose.yml](#docker-compose-file) file on this page.
