## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

## Install Appsmith
Create a folder named `appsmith` on your machine for deployment and data storage. Then, navigate to this folder using the `cd` command and follow the steps below:

1. To download the `docker-compose.yml` file, run the following cURL command:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
   ```
This command saves the file in the current directory.

2. Start the Docker container using the following command. You may need to run with `sudo` if you don't have permission to run `docker-compose`. 

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

3. Open [https://localhost](https://localhost) and wait for the server to come up. This can take up to 5 minutes. Once the server is up and running, you can access Appsmith at [https://localhost](https://localhost).
