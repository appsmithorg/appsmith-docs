# Docker

Docker is an open source [containerization](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/learn/containerization) platform. It enables developers to package applications into standardized executable components called containers. These containers combine the application's source code with the Operating System (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

1. Create an installation folder called `appsmith` for deployment and data storage.
2. `cd` into the installation folder.

## Setup with Docker Compose _(recommended)_

The Appsmith Docker image contains all the components required to run, within a single Docker container. All these multiple processes are managed by a [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) instance, which is a lightweight process manager.

1. Click to download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/3h08WqB) file, and place it into the Appsmith installation folder.

   **OR,** run the following cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://bit.ly/3h08WqB -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. Start the Docker container by running the command below. This may need to be run with sudo if `docker` and `docker-compose` aren't accessible by the user. If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The Appsmith server should be up and running soon, and it can be accessed at [http://localhost](http://localhost). Check the [Docker logs](#docker-logs) to verify that the instance is working correctly.

To upgrade from Community Edition to Business Edition, [follow these instructions](/getting-started/setup/upgrade-to-business-edition/docker).
:::

1. Click to download the [`docker-compose.yml`](/img/docker-compose_(3).yml) file, and place it into the Appsmith installation folder.

   **OR,** run the following cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://bit.ly/3AQzII6 -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. Change the **image** name from `appsmith-ce` to `appsmith-ee` for the `image:` key in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Add the **license key** to the `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:
   ```yml
   services:
      appsmith:
         # ...
         environment:
            APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>
   ```

4. Start the Docker container by running the command below. This may need to be run with sudo if `docker` and `docker-compose` aren't accessible by the user. If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The Appsmith server should be up and running soon, and it can be accessed at [http://localhost](http://localhost). Check the [Docker logs](#docker-logs) to verify that the instance is working correctly.

### Updating Appsmith

To update Appsmith manually, go to the root directory of the installation and run the following command:

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && docker-compose up -d
```

### Enabling Appsmith auto updates

Automatic updates are turned off by default in the docker-compose.yml file. To enable them, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the root directory of the Appsmith installation and run:

   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file with any text editor and un-comment lines 13-23.
3. Save the file and run:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

:::info
To complement automatic updates, Appsmith also has an auto backup feature. Before an automatic update, Appsmith first creates a backup to allow [rolling back](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#restore-appsmith-instance) an update to a previous version of Appsmith if necessary. For this auto backup to work, please ensure that there is a minimum of 2 GB of free storage; otherwise, both the backup and update tasks fail.
:::

This configuration runs an Appsmith instance and a Watchtower instance to keep Appsmith automatically up-to-date. The installation is now configured to stay up-to-date automatically.

## Setup with Docker run

<Tabs groupId="editions">
   <TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community">

This command downloads the image and starts Appsmith:

```bash
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" --pull always appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Business Edition" value="business">

This command downloads the image and starts Appsmith:

```bash
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" -e APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> --pull always appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Updating Appsmith

To update Appsmith manually, go to the root directory of the installation and run the following commands:

```bash
docker rmi appsmith/appsmith-ce -f
docker pull appsmith/appsmith-ce
docker rm -f appsmith
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

   <TabItem label="Business Edition" value="business">

To update Appsmith manually, go to the root directory of the installation and run the following commands:

```bash
docker rmi appsmith/appsmith-ee -f
docker pull appsmith/appsmith-ee
docker rm -f appsmith
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" -e APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the download is complete, the server should be up soon. You can verify that it's working correctly in the [Docker logs](#docker-logs).

## Docker logs

Once the Appsmith container is ready, the message "Appsmith is Running!" is displayed in the Docker logs.

![Appsmith is running message](/img/InstallationGuides__Docker__AppsmithRunningMessage.png)

You can follow the logs with the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f appsmith
```

Backend/Server logs are stored in `stacks/logs/backend/backend.log`. You can access backend logs from your Appsmith deployment by following these steps:

* Navigate to the folder where Appsmith was deployed, open the `logs` folder within the `stacks` folder.
* Find the `backend` folder.
* Retrieve the `.log` files and bundle them in a `.zip` file. 

:::note
Logs don't contain any sensitive information that would pose a risk to share. However, you can remove any personally identifiable information (PII) using [scrubadub library](https://github.com/LeapBeyond/scrubadub).
:::

## Restarting containers

If the Docker containers are failing to restart, download ,and run the [`restart-container.sh`](/img/restart-container.sh) script linked below to bring them up:

Copy the script (`restart-container.sh`) to the installation folder and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x restart-container.sh
./restart-container.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If there are any errors during this process, follow the guide on [debugging deployment errors](/help-and-support/troubleshooting-guide/deployment-errors). If there are still issues, please contact [support@appsmith.com](mailto:support@appsmith.com) or join the Appsmith [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp) to speak to the Appsmith team directly.
