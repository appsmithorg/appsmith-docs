## Install

Follow the steps below to install Appsmith using Docker Compose:

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file for the edition that you are using:

   * **Community Edition** - Click to download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE) file and place it into the Appsmith installation folder. **Or,** run the following cURL:

      ```bash
      curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
      ```
   * **Business Edition** - Click to download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/docker-compose-be) file, and place it into the Appsmith installation folder. **Or,** run the following cURL command:

      ```bash
         curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-be -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
      ```

2. Use the below command to start the Docker container. If you can't access `docker` and `docker-compose`, you may need to run the command with `sudo`. The command downloads the docker image if not available on your computer.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
Upon restarting the server, Appsmith is deployed and accessible through [http://localhost](http://localhost). You may verify that the instance is functioning correctly by checking the [instance logs](/learning-and-resources/how-to-guides/how-to-get-container-logs#docker).

:::info important
If you already have a **Business Edition** license key, sign in to your Appsmith account, and enter your license key to activate the instance. If you need a license key, sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com).
