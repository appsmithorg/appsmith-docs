# Docker

Docker is an open source [containerization](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/learn/containerization) platform. It enables developers to package applications into standardized executable components called containers. These containers combine the application's source code with the Operating System (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

1. Create an installation folder called `appsmith` for deployment and data storage.
2. `cd` into the installation folder.

## Setup with Docker Compose _(recommended)_

The Appsmith Docker image contains all the components required to run within a single Docker container. All these multiple processes are managed by a [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) instance, which is a lightweight process manager.

   <TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community">

1. Click to download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/3h08WqB) file and place it into the Appsmith installation folder.

   **OR,** run the following cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://bit.ly/3h08WqB -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. Start the Docker container by running the command below. This may need to be run with sudo if `docker` and `docker-compose` aren't accessible by the user. If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The Appsmith server should be up and running soon and can be accessed at [http://localhost](http://localhost). Check the [Docker logs](#docker-logs) to verify that the instance is working correctly.

:::note
To upgrade from Community Edition to Business Edition, [follow these instructions](/getting-started/setup/upgrade-to-business-edition/docker).
:::

1. Click to download the [`docker-compose.yml`](/img/docker-compose_(3).yml) file, and place it into the Appsmith installation folder.

   **OR,** run the following cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://bit.ly/3AQzII6 -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. Change the **image** name from `appsmith-ce` to `appsmith-ee` for the `image:` key in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Add the **license key** to the `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:
   ```yml
   services:
      appsmith:
         # ...
         environment:
            APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>
   ```

4. Start the Docker container by running the command below. This may need to be run with sudo if `docker` and `docker-compose` aren't accessible by the user. If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The Appsmith server should be up and running soon and can be accessed at [http://localhost](http://localhost). Check the [Docker logs](#docker-logs) to verify that the instance is working correctly.

### Updating Appsmith
:::caution
   It's recommended to backup the Appsmith instance before performing an update. For more information, see [How to create a backup](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#backup-appsmith-instance).
:::

To update Appsmith manually, go to the root directory of the installation and run the following command:

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && docker-compose up -d
```

### Enabling Appsmith auto updates

Automatic updates are turned off by default in the `docker-compose.yml` file. To enable them, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the root directory of the Appsmith installation and run:

   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file with any text editor and un-comment lines 13-23.
3. Save the file and run:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

In addition to automatic updates, Appsmith also offers an auto backup feature. Before any update, Appsmith creates a backup, which can be used to rollback to a previous version of Appsmith in case the update needs to be undone. For more information, see [the rollback instructions using the `appsmithctl` command](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#restore-appsmith-instance). To ensure successful auto backup and update tasks, a minimum of 2 GB of free storage must be available; otherwise, both the backup and update tasks may fail.

:::note 
To ensure automatic backups before updates, enable the `WATCHTOWER_LIFECYCLE_HOOKS` environment variable in the [docker-compose.yaml](https://bit.ly/3h08WqB) file on the Watchtower instance.
:::

If you have updated your Appsmith instance and face any issues. You can rollback the changes and [restore the Appsmith instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#restore-appsmith-instance) from a backup archive. This configuration runs an Appsmith instance and a Watchtower instance to keep Appsmith automatically up-to-date. The installation is now configured to stay up-to-date automatically.

## Setup with Docker run

<Tabs groupId="editions">
   <TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community">

This command downloads the image and starts Appsmith:

```bash
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" --pull always appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Business Edition" value="business">

This command downloads the image and starts Appsmith:

```bash
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" -e APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> --pull always appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

   </TabItem>

### Updating Appsmith

To update Appsmith manually, go to the root directory of the installation and run the following commands:

```bash
docker rmi appsmith/appsmith-ce -f
docker pull appsmith/appsmith-ce
docker rm -f appsmith
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" appsmith/appsmith-ce
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Business Edition" value="business">

To update Appsmith manually, go to the root directory of the installation and run the following commands:

```bash
docker rmi appsmith/appsmith-ee -f
docker pull appsmith/appsmith-ee
docker rm -f appsmith
docker run -d --name appsmith -p 80:80 -v "$PWD/stacks:/appsmith-stacks" -e APPSMITH_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> appsmith/appsmith-ee
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the download is complete, the server should be up soon. You can verify that it's working correctly in the [Docker logs](#docker-logs).

## Docker logs

Once the Appsmith container is ready, the message "Appsmith is Running!" is displayed in the Docker logs.

![Appsmith is running message](/img/InstallationGuides__Docker__AppsmithRunningMessage.png)

You can follow the **frontend logs** with the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f appsmith
```

**Backend logs** are stored in `stacks/logs/backend/backend.log`. Backend logs can assist debugging by providing information on requests, responses, and errors. They can help identify and resolve problems in your application. For more information, see [How to get backend logs](https://github.com/felix-appsmith/guide-how-to-get-logs-appsmith).


## Restarting containers

If the Docker containers are failing to restart, download, and run the [`restart-container.sh`](/img/restart-container.sh) script linked below to bring them up:

Copy the script (`restart-container.sh`) to the installation folder and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x restart-container.sh
./restart-container.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If there are any errors during this process, follow the guide on [debugging deployment errors](/help-and-support/troubleshooting-guide/deployment-errors) or send an email to [support@appsmith.com](mailto:support@appsmith.com) or join the Appsmith [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp) to speak to the Appsmith team directly.
