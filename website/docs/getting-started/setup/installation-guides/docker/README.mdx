## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

## Install Appsmith

Follow these steps to install Appsmith:

1. Create a folder named `appsmith` on your machine for deployment and data storage. Navigate to this folder using the `cd` command.

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with:

   ```yaml
   version: "3"
      services:
      appsmith:
         #highlight-next-line
         image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
         container_name: appsmith
         ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
         volumes:
            - ./stacks:/appsmith-stacks
         restart: unless-stopped
   ```

3. Start the Docker container by using the below command. You may need to use `sudo` if you don't have permission to run `docker-compose`:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will download the necessary Docker image if it doesn't exist locally and start the container.

4. Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) and wait for the server to come up. This can take up to 5 minutes. Once the server is up and running, you can access Appsmith at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

5. Fill in your details to create an administrator account.

6. Once you've created an account, you can either start with the free plan or activate your instance with a license key. If you want to generate a license key, sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com) to create one, and then proceed to activate your instance using the newly generated license key.

## Install Appsmith Community

To install the Appsmith open source edition (Appsmith Community), under step 2 of the [Install Appsmith](#install-appsmith) section on this page, replace `appsmith-ee` with `appsmith-ce` for the `image` attribute while creating the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Troubleshooting

If you are facing issues during deployment, please refer to the guide on [troubleshooting deployment errors](/help-and-support/troubleshooting-guide/deployment-errors).

If you continue to face issues, contact the support team using the chat widget at the bottom right of this page.
