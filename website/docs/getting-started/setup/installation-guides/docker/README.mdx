## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)
3. Create a folder named `appsmith` for deployment and data storage, then navigate to it using `cd` command.

## Install

Follow the steps below to install Appsmith using Docker Compose:

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file for the edition that you are using:

<Tabs groupId="editions" >
<TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community">

Download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE) file and place it into the Appsmith installation folder. Or run the following cURL:

```bash
curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Business Edition" value="business">

Download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/docker-compose-be) file, and place it into the Appsmith installation folder. Or run the following cURL command:

```bash
 curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-be -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. To start the Docker container, use the following command. If you're unable to access `docker` and `docker-compose`, you may need to run the command with `sudo`. The below command downloads the Docker image if not present on your computer.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The server deploys Appsmith at startup, and you can access it at [http://localhost](http://localhost). You can check the  [instance logs](/learning-and-resources/how-to-guides/how-to-get-container-logs#docker) to verify that the instance is up and running.

:::info important
If you are on a Business Edition, after logging into your Appsmith account, enter your license key to activate the instance. If you need a license key, sign up for a free trial at [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com).
