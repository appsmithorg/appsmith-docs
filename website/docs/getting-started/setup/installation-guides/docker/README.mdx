<VideoEmbed host="youtube" videoId="Tde7GqE6FQQ" title="How to install Appsmith using Docker" 
caption="How to install Appsmith using Docker"/> 

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)
3. Create a folder named `appsmith` for deployment and data storage, then navigate to it using `cd` command.

## Install

Follow the steps below to install Appsmith using Docker Compose:

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file for the edition that you are using:

<Tabs groupId="editions" >
<TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community">

There are two ways in which you can download the `docker-compose.yml` file:
   
* Download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE) file and place it into the Appsmith installation folder. 

* Or run the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-CE -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Business Edition" value="business">

:::info
To upgrade your Community Edition to Business Edition, see [Upgrade to Business Edition using Docker](/getting-started/setup/upgrade-to-business-edition/docker).
:::

1. Sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com) and generate a trial license key.

2. There are two ways in which you can download the `docker-compose.yml` file:
   * Download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://bit.ly/docker-compose-be) file, and place it into the Appsmith installation folder. 
   
   * Run the following cURL command:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://bit.ly/docker-compose-be -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. To start the Docker container, use the following command. You may have to run the command with `sudo` if you don't have permission to execute `docker-compose`. The below command downloads the Docker image if not present locally.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The server deploys Appsmith at startup, and you can access it at [http://localhost](http://localhost). You can also check the message "Appsmith is Running!" displayed in docker logs by using `docker logs -f appsmith` command.
