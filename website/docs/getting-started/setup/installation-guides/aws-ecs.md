# AWS ECS

## Prerequisites

### 1: Register With Amazon Web Services

If you already have an Amazon Web Services account, you may skip this step.

Please follow the steps [detailed here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) in order to create an account on AWS.

### 2: Generate an SSH key pair

If you already have an SSH key pair for the AWS region you are operating in, you can skip this step.

Please follow the steps [detailed here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair) to generate a new key pair. You need this key to SSH into your AWS EC2 instance.

### 3: Create an AWS Security Group

If you already have an existing security group with ports 80, 443, 22 and 9001 open, you can skip this step.

Appsmith is a web application that requires ports 80 and 443 for HTTP access, port 22 to be accessible for SSH access, it also requires port 9001 to be accessible for the [supervisord UI](http://supervisord.org/running.html). Please follow the steps [detailed here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group) to create a new security group.

While creating the new security group, please follow the steps [detailed here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule) to edit the "Inbound Rules" and make ports 80, 443, 22 and 9001 accessible from anywhere.

## ECS Overview

![ECS OVERVIEW](/img/ecs-overview.png)

## Steps to Deploy Appsmith on ECS (using EC2 Launch Type):

1. [Create an ECS Cluster](#step-1-create-an-ecs-cluster)
2. [Create Task and Container Definitions](#step-2-create-task-and-container-definitions)
3. [Create and Run an ECS Service](#step-3-create-and-run-an-ecs-service)

> Note: Please switch to the old AWS console UI to follow the steps in this tutorial.

### Step 1: Create an ECS Cluster

1. Navigate to Amazon ECS and choose clusters on the side bar and select `Create Cluster`.

![Creating Cluster in AWS ECS](/img/spaces\_-Lzuzdhj8LjrQPaeyCxr-3757176148\_uploads\_git-blob-217fcdb99846c6da6b6b5b374ec8ceb61ff5c221\_ecs-start-dash.png)

2\. Choose **EC2 Linux + Networking**, and select the next step.

3\. Enter your cluster name

4\. Instance configuration:

* Select the provisioning model as **On-Demand Instance**.
* Select the server size you wish to use, and set the **Number of instances** as **1**.
* Select the **Amazon Linux2 AMI** for the EC2 AMI ID dropdown, and enter the required EBS volume size.
* Select a **Key pair**. Please refer to [Prerequisite 2](#2-generate-an-ssh-key-pair), if you haven't already created one.

![Configuring the instance](/img/spaces\_-Lzuzdhj8LjrQPaeyCxr-3757176148\_uploads\_git-blob-9b572559c7d254290a9d0e928d54b07d4314d60e\_ecs-cluster-instance-config.png)

5\. Networking Section

* Select the **default VPC** followed by selecting the **first subnet** from the drop-down.
* Select the **security group** created in [Prerequisite 3](#3-create-an-aws-security-group).

![Configuring the Networking Section](/img/ecs-cluster-networking.png)

6\. Enable container insights (this gives CloudWatch monitoring and helps to debug).

7\. Leave the Container instance IAM role as default (**ecsInstanceRole**), if you don't have one AWS creates it for you.

8\. Hit the **Create button**. It may take a minute for your cluster to be ready.

![ECS Cluster Status](/img/spaces\_-Lzuzdhj8LjrQPaeyCxr-3757176148\_uploads\_git-blob-838febeb60a4267fe023333877400abfa9cdecbe\_ecs-cluster-launch.png)

### Step 2: Create Task and Container Definitions

Once the cluster is created, you need to create a task that runs on the cluster created in [**Step 1**](#step-1-create-an-ecs-cluster).

1. On the sidebar, choose **Task Definitions** and select **Create new Task Definition**.
2. Choose **EC2** as the **launch type**, and proceed to the next step.
3. Configure task and definition
   * Enter the task definition name.
   * Leave the Task role **blank**.
   * Select the **default** Network mode

![Configuration of the Task](</img/ecs-task-def_(1)_(1)_(1)_(2)_(1).png>)

4\. Select the default Task execution IAM role (**ecsTaskExecutionRole**). AWS creates one for you if you don't have one.

5\. Set the required **task size** (memory & CPU)

6\. Go to the **Volumes** section and add a new volume. Enter the Name as `appsmith_stack`, set Volume type as **Bind Mount,** and set the **Source path** to `/Appsmith/stacks`.

![Volume Configuration](/img/ecs\_volume.png)

7\. Configure **Appsmith container configuration**.

* Hit **Add container** button.
* Enter the container name, and set the Image to `appsmith/appsmith-ce`
* Add port mappings for the ports **80->80,443->443, 9001->9001**
* Set the _Mount points Source volume_ to `appsmith_stack` and set the Container path to `/appsmith-stacks`

![Storage Setting](</img/ecs\_mount_(1).png>)

* Enable **Auto-configure CloudWatch Logs** for log configuration.
* Hit **Add.**

![Conainer Port Configuration](</img/ecs-task-appsmith_(1)_(1)_(1)_(2).png>)

* Finally, hit the **Create** button.

### Step 3: Create and Run an ECS Service.

1. Navigate to the **clusters dashboard** and click the ECS cluster created in [**Step 1**]/(aws-ecs#step-1-create-an-ecs-cluster).
2. On the cluster details, under the **Services tab** hit the **create** button.

![Cluster Dashboard](/img/ecs-cluster-service-creation.png)

3\. Configure Service

* Select **EC2** as Launch Type.
* Select the **Task Definition** created in [**Step 2**](#step-2-create-task-and-container-definitions) with the latest revision.
* Select the **Cluster** created in [**Step 1**](#step-1-create-an-ecs-cluster).
* Enter the service name.
* Select the **REPLICA** Service type.
* Set the **Number of tasks** to **1**.
* Leave the remaining fields and sections with the **default values**, and proceed to the next step.

4\. Configure network - Proceed to the next step with the **default** configurations.

![](</img/ecs-service-lb_(1)_(1)_(1)_(2)_(3).png>)

5\. Set Auto Scaling - Proceed to the next step with the **default** configuration.

![Setting Up Auto Scaling](/img/spaces\_-Lzuzdhj8LjrQPaeyCxr-3757176148\_uploads\_git-blob-c530f8614a433bc339b500c3859d7332960ac0fc\_ecs-service-auto-scaling.png)

6\. Review the Service configurations and hit the **Create Service** button.

![Review Section](/img/spaces\_-Lzuzdhj8LjrQPaeyCxr-3757176148\_uploads\_git-blob-d41afa800108de88c398d00edf945db81077d4c0\_ecs-service-review.png)

7\. The following screen is shown with the **launch status**, click the **View Service** button.

![Launch Status Dashboard](/img/spaces\_-Lzuzdhj8LjrQPaeyCxr-3757176148\_uploads\_git-blob-6e59de9348c02c19d5b8bf0871b056ebf8ec5a97\_ecs-service-launch-status.png)

8\. You are directed to the **service detail** page. Your task is listed under the **Tasks tab** on the cluster. refresh the table until the status is **RUNNING**.

![Service Detail Page](/img/ecs-service-task-status.png)

9\. Click on the **task** to get the details of your running service.

![Task Dashboard](/img/spaces\_-Lzuzdhj8LjrQPaeyCxr-3757176148\_uploads\_git-blob-0e04e6250702a263e7398969ee75be5b82a4f1f4\_ecs-task-details.png)

10\. Finally, click on the **EC2 instance id** to navigate to the EC2 console with your ECS instance (which is basically an EC2 instance running the container service) listed.

![EC2 Console](/img/spaces\_-Lzuzdhj8LjrQPaeyCxr-3757176148\_uploads\_git-blob-d598b204016d7ceb09c3e8f229d6b0efc0a9a71c\_ecs-instance-ec2.png)

11\. Find the **public IP address** or **DNS name** and enter it on your browser to see Appsmith's welcome page.
