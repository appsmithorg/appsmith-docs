This page outlines the steps to configure Appsmith Google Cloud Run installation for high availability and scalability.

## Prerequisites

* A [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) account.
* An Appsmith Commercial Edition installation on Google Cloud Run. If not installed yet, see the [Google Cloud Run installation guide](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/google-cloud-run) for installing Appsmith.
* For scalable, secure, and highly available services, enable [Memorystore for Redis API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
* Ensure that you have taken a manual backup for your instance.

## Create a Redis instance

1. Go to the [Memorystore for Redis](https://console.cloud.google.com/memorystore/redis/instances) page in the Google Cloud console.

2. Click **Create Instance**.
    
3. On the **Create a Redis instance** page, enter the configurations as shown below:

    * In the **Instance ID** field, set an id. Example: `instanceid`.
    * In the **Tier Selection** list, select one of the options:
      * **Basic**: One primary Redis node. No automatic failover for High Availability.
      * **Standard**: Provides *High Availability* and fails over to replica in case of primary node failure.
    For more information about tiers, see [Redis Tier Capabilities](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/redis-tiers).
    * In the **Capacity** box, enter `10`.
    * In the **Region** box, select a region for your instance.
    * In the **Zone** box, select a zone for your instance.
    * If you selected the **Standard** tier above, in the **Configure read replicas** dropdown list, select **2 Read Replicas** .
    * Under **Set up connection**, select the **default** option for **Network**.
    * Expand the **Configuration** section. Select **6.x** option(recommended) for **Version**.

4. Click the **Create** button.

5. Once the Redis instance is ready, note down the **Primary Endpoint** to use later.

## Edit and deploy new revision

1. Go to your cloud run console.
2. Select your Appsmith Service, and click **EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION**.
3. Under **Environment variables**, click **Add Variable** button to add below variable in the **Name** and **Value** text boxes as shown below: <br/>

| Name | Value |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------| 
| **APPSMITH_REDIS_URL** | If you followed the steps in the [Create Redis Instance](#create-a-redis-instance) section, add the host and port from the Primary Endpoint of the Redis instance you noted down in step 5. Ensure that there is no trailing spaces in the Redis URL.  <br/><br/> <i>Format</i>: <br/>`redis://<HOST>:<PORT>`|

4. Click **Deploy** button. A green check mark will appear next to the newly deployed service name when it's ready.
5. Verify that the new revision is working as expected by accessing Appsmith, and logging into your account.
6. Again click **EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION**.
7. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and uncheck the **Serve this revision immediately** checkbox.
8. Click **Deploy** button. A green check mark will appear next to the newly deployed revision when it's ready.

## Manage traffic between revisions

Follow the steps below to split traffic between among revisions.

3. Click the **Revisions** tab.
4. Click the **MANAGE TRAFFIC** button.
5. Select the revisions that you created as part of [Edit and deploy new revision](#edit-and-deploy-new-revision) section.
7. Specify the traffic percentage that you want to assign to each revision.
6. Click **Save**.
