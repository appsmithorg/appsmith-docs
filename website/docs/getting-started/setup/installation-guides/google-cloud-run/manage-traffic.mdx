# Configure Google Cloud Run for SSO

This page provides steps to configure Google Cloud Run Appsmith installation for high availability and scalability.

## Prerequisites

* A [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) account.
* An Appsmith installation on Google Cloud Run.
* If you want scalable, secure, and highly available services, enable [Memorystore for Redis API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).


## Create a Redis instance

This guide is optional, and you can skip to [Create Service](#create-service). Follow the steps below if you want scalable, secure, and highly available services. Ensure you have enabled the **Memorystore for Redis** API as mentioned in step 5 of the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section.

1. Go to the [Memorystore for Redis](https://console.cloud.google.com/memorystore/redis/instances) page in the Google Cloud console.

2. Click **Create Instance**.
    
3. On the **Create a Redis instance** page, enter the configurations as shown below:

    - In the **Instance ID** field, set an id. Example: `instanceid`.
    - In the **Tier Selection** list, select one of the options:
      - **Basic**: One primary Redis node. No automatic failover for High Availability.
      - **Standard**: Provides *High Availability* and fails over to replica in case of primary node failure.
    For more information about tiers, see [Redis Tier Capabilities](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/redis-tiers).
    - In the **Capacity** box, enter `10`.
    - In the **Region** box, select a region for your instance.
    - In the **Zone** box, select a zone for your instance.
    - If you selected the **Standard** tier above, in the **Configure read replicas** dropdown list, select **2 Read Replicas** .
    - Under **Set up connection**, select the **default** option for **Network**.
    - Expand the **Configuration** section. Select **6.x** option(recommended) for **Version**.

4. Click the **Create** button.

5. Once the Redis instance is ready, note down the **Primary Endpoint** to use later.

## Manage traffic between revisions

Follow the steps below if you have created a Redis instance in the steps above to split traffic between multiple revisions.

1. Go to [Cloud Run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run).

2. Locate the service in the services list, and click on it.

3. Click the **Revisions** tab.

4. Click the **ï¸™** icon under **Actions** next to the service.

5. Specify the percentage of traffic to be shared. To split traffic between more revisions, click **Add Revision**, select the desired revision, and set the percentage to the desired split.

6. Click **Save**.
