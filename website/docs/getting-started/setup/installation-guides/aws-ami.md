# AWS AMI
This page provides steps to install Appsmith using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

## Prerequisites

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. If you don't have one, [Create an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
- An Amazon EC2 key pair. If you don't have one, [Generate an SSH Key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair).
- An Amazon Security group with ports 80, 443, and 22 accessible. If you don't have one, [Create a Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group).
- To enable port access, [add an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule) for the port ranges 80, 443, and 22 to the security group you created above.
- Ensure you have created the security group and the SSH key pair in the same region.
