# AWS AMI

This page provides steps to install Appsmith using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

## Prerequisites

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. If you don't have one, [Create an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
- An Amazon EC2 key pair. If you don't have one, [Generate an SSH Key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair).
- An Amazon Security group with ports 80, 443, and 22 accessible. If you don't have one, [Create a Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#creating-security-group).
- To enable port access, [add an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule) for the port ranges 80, 443, and 22 to the security group you created above.
- To allow outbound traffic, add an outbound rule to permit all traffic. If you need specific restrictions, customize the outbound rules according to your requirements.
- Ensure you have created the security group and the SSH key pair in the same region.

### Verify Appsmith installation

1. On the **Launch status** screen, click the **EC2 instance id** available in the bracket.

2. Click the **Instance ID** to access the **Instance Summary** page.

3. Copy the **Public IPv4 address** available on the **Instance Summary** page.

4. Paste it in a browser tab and wait for the server to come up. It can take up to 5 minutes. 
 
5. Once the server is up and running, you can see the login screen of Appsmith.

### Login with root admin

1. Username: `appsmith@example.com`

2. Find the password in one of the below ways:

- SSH into your server using your private key and find the application credentials with:
  ```
  sudo cat /home/ubuntu/appsmith/credential
  ```
- **Or** review the system log, by selecting **Get System Log** from the **Actions** drop-down menu for your instance. The credentials are printed in the logs as shown below:

:::caution Attention
The application password is **only** available in system logs for the initial 24 hours. It's recommended that create a new admin user and delete the `appsmith@example.com user` immediately.

3. Once you've created an account, you can either start with the free plan or activate your instance with a license key. If you want to generate a license key, sign up on [customer.appsmith.com](https://customer.appsmith.com) to create one, and then proceed to activate your instance using the newly generated license key.
