# Admin Settings

The Admin Settings page allows [instance administrators](#add-instance-administrator) on self-hosted instances to manage instance configurations, including email, authentication, Google Maps integration, as well as user settings and permissions. This page provides instructions on how to configure your self-hosted Appsmith instance using *Admin Settings* available on the Instance Administrator's dashboard.

:::caution Important
If you have set values using [environment variables](#environment-variables) for your instance, those values take precedence over values specified in the Admin Settings UI.

## General
The **General** settings allow you to configure basic but essential settings for your self-hosted Appsmith instance. These include details about the instance name, administrators, and other general configurations that impact the overall functionality and behavior of the instance.

### Instance name
Modify the name of your self-hosted instance.

### Admin email
Specify the email addresses of users who should have instance administrator privileges on your self-hosted instance. You can add multiple emails separated by commas. Users who are granted the Instance Administrator role have full access to all the instance settings. If you don’t see the _Admin Settings_ icon in the top-right corner, you’re not an Instance Administrator for the Appsmith instance and must be granted instance administrator role by an existing instance administrator.

If you want to grant Instance Administrator privileges to a user, add their email address to the **Admin email** field in the **Settings** > **General** section. Doing so automatically assigns them the Instance Administrator role, giving them full access to manage instance settings. For more information about Instance Administrator role, see [Instance Administrator Role](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/default-roles#instance-administrator-role) reference.
