### Subcommands

Subcommands allow you to trigger different operations like exporting or importing databases.

| [`restore`](#restore)               | Restore the Appsmith instance from a backup. |

:::info
With **Business Edition,** you can also sync the backups to an AWS S3 bucket.
:::

## Export database

Use the following command to back up Appsmith's database.

:::info
You can restore the backups onto another instance using the [import](#im-import_db) command to restore data.
:::

### `ex`, `export_db`

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="dockercommands"> 

Before running this, ensure you are in the directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located.

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl export_db
```

The output file is stored in the container directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive`. Thanks to the volume configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file, it should be available on your host machine at `./stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive`.

If your volume configuration is different or unavailable, you can use the following command to copy the archive file to your host disk:

```bash
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive .
```

:::info
You may want to **save** the `docker.env` file in addition to this **archive** file if you intend to be able to reproduce this environment elsewhere in case of a disaster,
:::

The `docker.env` file can be copied from the container with the following command:

```bash
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env .
```

:::note
Please save the encryption environment variables `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` and `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT`values, from docker.env because the backup archive does not include them for security reasons.

## Import database

The following command can restore the backup archive created by the [export](#ex-export\_db) command.

### `im`, `import_db`

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="dockercommands"> 

* First, copy the archive file into the container using the following command:

```bash
docker cp ./appsmith-data.archive appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/restore/
```

* Second, run the following command to import data from this file:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl import_db
```

:::info
You may also want to copy the `docker.env` from the original instance into this one when you restore.
:::

* Copy the `docker.env` file using the below command:

:::tip
If you are in the installation folder and `docker.env` exists in the same folder. If not, please append the path where the file resides to the below command.
:::

```bash
docker cp ./docker.env appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/configuration/
```

* Restart the Appsmith server using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith supervisorctl restart backend
```

## Backup Appsmith instance

Use the following command to create a backup archive of the Appsmith instance. 


The backup includes the database, `docker.env` data, and Git data.

### `backup`

Use the command to backup the archive.

:::info
The backed-up archive can then be used to restore an Appsmith instance to the previous state using the [restore](#restore) command.
:::

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="dockercommands"> 

Before running this, ensure you are in the docker host root directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located.

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl backup
```

The archive file is stored in the container directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/`. Thanks to the volume configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file, it should be available on your host machine at `./stacks/data/backup/`

:::danger
Please save the **encryption env values**, `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` and `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT,` from `docker.env` because the backup archive **does not include** them for security reasons
:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Kubernetes" value="kubernetescommands"> 
Follow the steps below to create a backup of your Appsmith instance:

<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
  
<TabItem label="Community Edition" value="communityEdition"> 

* Create a backup with:

```bash
kubectl exec appsmith-0 appsmithctl backup
```
The archive file is stored in the container directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/`.

* Copy the archive file
```bash
kubectl cp appsmith-0:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-backup-<TIME-STAMP>.tar.gz appsmith-backup-<TIME-STAMP>.tar.gz
```

:::danger
Save the **encryption env values**, `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` and `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT,` from `values.yaml` because the backup archive **does not include** them for security reasons.

## Restore Appsmith instance

The following command can be used to restore an Appsmith instance from a backup archive.

### `restore`

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="dockercommands"> 

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl restore
```

The command first lists all the backup archives in the directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` in ascending/chronological order (the most recent backup archive at the bottom).

:::note
You may see a **warning** if you restore an instance with an **older Appsmith version**. You can follow the **instructions to update** the `docker-compose.yml` file with the correct Appsmith image corresponding to the **instance to be restored**.
:::

Enter the index of the corresponding backup archive you want to use to restore.

![Command Line Interface :`appsmithctl` restore](/img/Restore\_appsmith\_1.png)

In the restored instance, you may use the existing encryption environment variables `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` and `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT` of the current Appsmith instance. You can also choose to add the corresponding variables to the backed-up instance.

## Sync backup (only for Business Edition)

```bash
appsmithctl backup --upload-to-s3
```

You can choose to sync backups to an AWS S3 bucket (**only for Business Edition**).

* Add the below entries to the `docker.env` file to enable the sync:

```
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<aws access key> 
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY=<aws secret key>
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name> 
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_REGION=<aws bucket region>
```


* Use the `--upload-to-s3` option for the **backup** command. The backup command reads bucket details set in the environment variables above and uploads the backup to it.

:::info
Once configured correctly, the [**restore**](#restore) command automatically lists the backups in the bucket and the local backups in the CLI menu.
