# Backup and Restore

Appsmith comes with the `appsmithctl` command line utility. You can use the command line to interact with and manage your Appsmith instance. For example, back up and restore your Appsmith instance and database. This page provides steps to run the backup and restore commands.

## Usage
```bash
appsmithctl <subcommand> <options>
```

### Subcommands

Subcommands allow you to trigger different operations like exporting or importing databases.

## Prerequisites

- The Appsmith instance should be up and running. If you haven't already installed Appsmith, refer to the [Installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides).
- Access to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands

:::info 
Appsmith may be offline for up to 5 minutes while performing a backup or restore.
:::

## Backup instance

You can create a backup archive of the Appsmith instance. The backup includes the database, `docker.env`, and Git data. Follow these steps to create a backup archive:

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="backup-docker-commands"> 

1. Go to the directory that has the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. Get your encryption details with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith cat /appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env | grep ENCRYPTION
```
Keep these details handy, as you need them for restoring the Appsmith instance.

3. Create a backup archive with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl backup
```
The backup archive file is stored in the `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` folder. You can access it on the host machine at `./stacks/data/backup/.`

4. If you can't access or have a different volume configuration, copy the archive file to your host disk with:

```bash
# Replace the appsmith-backup-<DATE-AND-TIMESTAMP>.tar.gz with the backup file name
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-backup-<DATE-AND-TIMESTAMP>.tar.gz .
```
This command copies the backup archive in your current directory.

## Backup database

Follow these steps to back up your Appsmith database:

:::caution Attention
Ensure that the name of the backup archive (`appsmith-data.archive`) isn't changed.
:::

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="export-docker-commands"> 

1. Go to the directory that has the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. Get your encryption details with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith cat /appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env | grep ENCRYPTION
```
Keep these details handy, as you need them for restoring the Appsmith database.

3. Create a backup archive with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl export_db
```

The backup archive file is stored in the `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` folder. You can access it on the host machine at ./stacks/data/backup/.

4. If you can't access or have a different volume configuration, copy the archive file to your host disk with:

```bash
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive .
```
This command copies the backup archive in your current directory.

5. To recreate the same environment elsewhere, copy the `docker.env` file with:

```bash
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env .
```
This command copies the `docker.env` file in your current directory.
