# Backup and Restore

Appsmith comes with the `appsmithctl` command line utility. You can use the command line to interact with and manage your Appsmith instance. For example, back up and restore your Appsmith instance and database. This page guides you through backup and restore commands and how to use them.

## Usage
```bash
appsmithctl <subcommand> <options>
```

### Subcommands

Subcommands allow you to trigger different operations like exporting or importing databases.

## Prerequisites

- The Appsmith instance should be up and running. If you haven't already installed Appsmith, refer to the [Appsmith installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) to install Appsmith.
- Access to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands

:::info 
During the backup and restore process in Appsmith, the application may be unavailable for a maximum of 5 minutes.

## Backup Appsmith instance

You can create a backup archive of the Appsmith instance. The backup includes the database, `docker.env` data, and Git data. Follow these steps to create a backup archive:

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="backup-docker-commands"> 

1. Go to the directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located.

2. Get your encryption details with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith cat /appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env | grep ENCRYPTION
```
Keep these details easily accessible as they are necessary if you intend to restore the Appsmith instance.

3. Create a backup archive with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl backup
```
If the `docker-compose.yml` file has a volume configuration, the backup archive file is stored in the container directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` and should be available on the host machine at `./stacks/data/backup/.`

4. If your volume configuration is different or unavailable, copy the archive file to your host disk with:

```bash
# Replace the <DATE-AND-TIMESTAMP> with the backup file date and timestamp
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-backup-<DATE-AND-TIMESTAMP>.tar.gz .
```
This command copies the backup archive in your current directory.

## Backup Appsmith database

Follow these steps to back up your Appsmith database:

:::caution Attention
It's important to note that the generated name of the backup archive (`appsmith-data.archive`) should not be changed since it's used in the restore command to restore the Appsmith database.
:::

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="export-docker-commands"> 

1. Go to the directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located.

2. Get your encryption details with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith cat /appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env | grep ENCRYPTION
```
Keep these details easily accessible as they are necessary if you intend to restore the Appsmith database.

3. Create a backup archive with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl export_db
```

If you've configured volume in the `docker-compose.yml` file, then the backup archive file (`appsmith-data.archive`) is stored in the `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` folder. 

4. If your volume configuration is different or unavailable, copy the archive file to your host disk with:

```bash
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive .
```
This command copies the backup archive in your current directory.

5. To recreate the same environment elsewhere, copy the `docker.env` file with:

```bash
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env .
```
This command copies the `docker.env` file in your current directory.

## Sync backup to S3 bucket

:::info
Sync your backups to an AWS S3 bucket is available only in the [Business Edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing) for self-hosted instances.
:::

Follow these steps for syncing backups to an S3 bucket for Docker and Kubernetes installations:

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="sync-docker-commands"> 

1. Go to the directory where the `docker.env` file is located.
2. Open the `docker.env` file and add the below entries:

```bash
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<aws access key> 
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY=<aws secret key>
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name> 
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_REGION=<aws bucket region>
```
3. Sync your backups to the S3 bucket with:
