# `appsmithctl`

Appsmith comes with the `appsmithctl` command-line utility, which allows you to manage your self-hosted instance and its internal database. This page provides detailed information about the `appsmithctl` command-line utility provided by Appsmith.

## Usage
<dd>
  The general syntax for using the `appsmithctl` command-line utility is:

  ```bash
  appsmithctl <subcommand> <options>
  ```

  - `appsmithctl`: This is the primary command used to interact with your self-hosted Appsmith instance.

  - `<subcommand>`: A placeholder for the specific operation you want to perform using [subcommands](#subcommands).

  - `<options>`: Optional flags or parameters needed by the subcommand. For example, to specify details, such as file paths, encryption settings, or S3 configuration options. 
</dd>
## Subcommands

<dd>
Subcommands allow you to perform different operations like creating backups, restoring backups, and more. Below is a detailed explanation of each subcommand available in `appsmithctl`.
</dd>

#### `--help`

<dd>
The `--help` subcommand provides a list of all subcommands and their options for the `appsmithctl` utility.

  ```bash
  appsmithctl --help
  ```
It's useful when you need guidance on the available commands or if you're unsure about the syntax of a specific subcommand.

</dd>

#### `backup`

<dd>
To create a backup of the Appsmith instance, use the following command:

  ```bash
  appsmithctl backup
  ```
  - The `backup` command creates a backup of your Appsmith instance, including the internal database, `docker.env`, and Git data. The backup file is encrypted using a password that you provided. This password is essential for restoring the backup later, so make sure to store it securely. If the password is forgotten, the backup cannot be restored.
  - The backup file is stored in the `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` directory within the container. On your local machine, it is accessible at `./stacks/data/backup/`.
  - The backup file follows the naming pattern `appsmith-backup-DATE_AND_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.enc`.

For more information about creating an Appsmith instance backup, see [Backup Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/backup-and-restore/backup-instance) guide.
</dd>

#### `export_db`

<dd>
To create a backup of the Appsmith internal database, use the following command:

  ```bash
  appsmithctl export_db
  ```
  - The `export_db` command creates a backup of the Appsmith internal database. The backup file is encrypted using a password that you provide. Ensure that you store this password securely, as it is required for restoring the database backup. If you forget the password, the backup cannot be restored.
  - The backup file is stored in the `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` directory within the container. On your local machine, it is accessible at `./stacks/data/backup/`.
  - The backup file follows the naming pattern `appsmith-db-backup-DATE_AND_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.enc`.

For more information about creating a database backup, see [Backup Database](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/backup-and-restore/backup-database) guide.
</dd>

#### `--upload-to-s3`

<dd>
For [Appsmith paid plans](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing), backups can be uploaded to an S3 bucket. To upload a backup file to an S3 bucket, use the following command:

  ```bash
  appsmithctl --upload-to-s3
  ```
  - This command uploads the backup file to the specified Amazon S3 bucket. If the S3 upload configuration is set up, the backup file is automatically uploaded to the specified bucket once created and becomes accessible there.
  - Ensure you have configured your S3 access credentials and bucket information in your `docker.env` or Helm chart configuration. For more information about syncing backups to S3, see [Sync Backup to S3](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/backup-and-restore/sync-backup-to-s3).
  
</dd>

#### `restore`

<dd>
- To restore an Appsmith instance from a backup, use the following command:

  ```bash
  appsmithctl restore
  ```
- The `restore` command restores the Appsmith instance, including the internal database, `docker.env`, and Git data, from an encrypted backup file. You will need the password used during the backup process to decrypt the backup. Without this password, the restore process will fail.
  - The restore process assumes that the backup file is located at `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` within the container.
  - The backup file should follow the naming pattern `appsmith-backup-DATE_AND_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.enc`.

For more information about restoring an Appsmith instance, see [Restore Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/backup-and-restore/restore-instance) guide.
</dd>

#### `import_db`

<dd>
- To restore the Appsmith internal database from a backup, use the following command:

  ```bash
  appsmithctl import_db
  ```
- The `import_db` command restores the Appsmith internal database from an encrypted backup file. You will need the password used during the backup process to decrypt the database. If you forget the password, the restore process will fail.
  - The restore process assumes that the backup file is located at `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` within the container.
  - The backup file should follow the naming pattern `appsmith-db-backup-DATE_AND_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.enc`.

For more information about restoring the Appsmith database, see [Restore Database](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/backup-and-restore/restore-database) guide.
