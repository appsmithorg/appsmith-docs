## Backup Appsmith instance

You can create a backup archive of the Appsmith instance. The backup includes the database, `docker.env` data, and Git data. Follow these steps to create a backup archive:

:::info
The backed-up archive can then be used to restore an Appsmith instance to the previous state using the [restore](#restore) command.
:::

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="backup-docker-commands"> 

1. Go to the docker host root directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located.

2. Create a backup archive with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl backup
```

The archive file is stored in the container directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/`. Thanks to the volume configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file, it should be available on your host machine at `./stacks/data/backup/`

:::danger
Please save the **encryption env values**, `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` and `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT,` from `docker.env` because the backup archive **does not include** them for security reasons

2. Create a backup with:

```bash
kubectl exec appsmith-0 appsmithctl backup

## Restore Appsmith instance

You can restore an Appsmith instance from a backup archive. Follow these steps to restore your Appsmith instance to a desired version:

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="restore-docker-commands"> 

1. Restore the Appsmith instance to one of the available backup archives with:
```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl restore
```

The command first lists all the backup archives in the directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` in ascending/chronological order (with the most recent backup archive at the bottom).

:::note
You may see a **warning** if you restore an instance with an **older Appsmith version**. You can follow the **instructions to update** the `docker-compose.yml` file with the correct Appsmith image corresponding to the **instance to be restored**.
:::

2. Enter the index of the corresponding backup archive you want to use to restore.

![Command Line Interface :`appsmithctl` restore](/img/Restore\_appsmith\_1.png)

In the restored instance, you may use the existing encryption environment variables `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` and `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT` of the current Appsmith instance. You can also choose to add the corresponding variables to the backed-up instance.

## Export database

Follow these steps to back up your Appsmith database:

:::info
You can restore the backups onto another instance using the [import](#im-import_db) command to restore data.
:::

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="export-docker-commands"> 

1. Go to the directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located.

2. Create a backup archive with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl export_db
```

The output file is stored in the container directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive`. Thanks to the volume configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file, it should be available on your host machine at `./stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive`.

If your volume configuration is different or unavailable, you can use the following command to copy the archive file to your host disk:

```bash
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive .
```

:::info
You may want to **save** the `docker.env` file in addition to this **archive** file if you intend to be able to reproduce this environment elsewhere in case of a disaster,
:::

The `docker.env` file can be copied from the container with the following command:

```bash
docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env .
```

:::note
Please save the encryption environment variables `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` and `APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT`values, from docker.env because the backup archive does not include them for security reasons.

## Sync backup (only for Business Edition)

```bash
appsmithctl backup --upload-to-s3
```

You can choose to sync backups to an AWS S3 bucket (**only for Business Edition**).

* Add the below entries to the `docker.env` file to enable the sync:

```
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<aws access key> 
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY=<aws secret key>
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name> 
APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_REGION=<aws bucket region>
```


* Use the `--upload-to-s3` option for the **backup** command. The backup command reads bucket details set in the environment variables above and uploads the backup to it.

:::info
Once configured correctly, the [**restore**](#restore) command automatically lists the backups in the bucket and the local backups in the CLI menu.
