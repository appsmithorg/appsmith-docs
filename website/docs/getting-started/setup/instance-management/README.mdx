# Instance Management
One of the key features of Appsmith is its instance management capabilities. Appsmith provides a variety of tools for managing instances so that you can:

* Configure a Maintenance Window for auto-updates to cut the downtime for your users
* Configure auto-updates to keep your Appsmith installation up-to-date
* Backup and Restore your Appsmith instance using command line utilities

The page provides steps for managing your Appsmith instance. 

## Maintenance window
A maintenance window is a defined time when you can perform maintenance tasks. For example, Appsmith updates, software updates, patches, and more. A maintenance window helps in reducing the impact on users during these activities.

### Configure maintenance window for auto-updates
You can choose a time slot for auto updates to happen. You've to set the time slot using a cron expression in the `--schedule` argument.

Below are some example configurations for common use cases:

* Check for updates every Sunday at 12:00 noon:

```bash
command: --schedule "0 0 12 ? * SUN" --label-enable --cleanup
```

* Check for updates every hour:

```bash
command: --schedule "0 0 * ? * *" --label-enable --cleanup
```
* Check for updates once at 12:00 midnight every day:

```bash
command: --schedule "0 0 12 * * ?" --label-enable --cleanup 
```
Follow these steps to update the `auto_update` container:
1. Go to the `docker-compose.yml` file
2. Open and update the `auto_update` attribute as shown below:

:::caution Attention
You must add a 6-value cron expression, not the traditional 5-value one. Refer to learn more about [How the cron expression works](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron@v1.2.0#hdr-CRON\_Expression\_Format).
:::

```yaml
auto_update:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    # Checks for update every 5 mins because of --interval
    #highlight-next-line
    command: --schedule "0 0 * ? * *" --label-enable --cleanup
    networks:
      - appsmith
    restart: always
```
3. Restart the `auto_update` container with:
```bash
sudo docker-compose pull && sudo docker-compose up --force-recreate auto_update
```
4. Verify the logs that the maintenance window is in effect with:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f auto_update
```

## Auto updates 

## Command line utilities
Command line utilities enable you to perform various tasks using a terminal. Appsmith supports the below command line utilities:
* `appsmithctl`
* `supervisorctl`

### appsmithctl
Appsmith comes with a command line utility, `appsmithctl`.  You can use it to:
* Backup your Appsmith instance
* Restore your Appsmith instance to a previous version
* Export the Appsmith database
* Import the Appsmith database to a previous version

For more information, see [How to use `appsmithctl` command line utility](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl). 

### supervisorctl
Appsmith also integrates with the `supervisorctl` command line utility. It handles the management of the Appsmith server, Nginx, MongoDB, and more. [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) also provides a web interface accessible on `http://localhost/supervisor`.

### Web interface

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>The web interface listing all the managed processes</i></figcaption>
</figure>

To setup the credentials for accessing the web interface, update the environment variables:
1. Go to the `docker.env` file available in the `stacks/configuration` folder.
2. Set the values for the below variables:
```
APPSMITH_SUPERVISOR_USER=<SUPERVISOR-USER>
APPSMITH_SUPERVISOR_PASSWORD=<SUPERVISOR-PASSWORD>
3. Use the interface to manage the Appsmith server, Nginx, MongoDB, and more.

### Command line interface
The command line interface also helps in managing the Appsmith server, Nginx, MongoDB, and more. 

For example:
* Check the status of all running processes with:

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith supervisorctl status
```

* View the last few lines of the `stderr` output of a specific process with: 

```bash
docker-compose exec appsmith supervisorctl tail <process_name> stderr
```

Refer to the official documentation of [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/running.html#supervisorctl-actions) to learn more about the `supervisorctl` actions.
