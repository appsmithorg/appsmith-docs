# Instance Management

## Switching off auto updates

In your `docker-compose.yml` file, the `auto_update` container is responsible for periodically checking for updates to Appsmith and applying those updates. If you wish to disable this auto updating, please run the below command:

```
docker-compose rm -s -v -f auto_update
```

This brings down the `auto_update` container, and update checks are no-longer performed. Note that however, if you run `docker-compose up -d` later, for any reason, then this `auto_update` will be brought up again. You can use that to turn auto updates on again in the future.

To check if auto updates are turned on in your instance, please run `docker-compose ps` and see if there a server called `auto_update` listed in the output, and if it's status is `Up`. If not, then auto updates are turned off for your instance.
