# Upgrade to Checkpoint Version (v1.9.2)

Checkpoint versions are milestone releases that ensure your Appsmith instance applies necessary database schema updates, optimizations, and compatibility fixes. If your current Appsmith version is older than `v1.9.2`, upgrading to this checkpoint version is mandatory before moving to later releases. This page provides step-by-step instructions to upgrade your self-hosted Appsmith instance to checkpoint version `v1.9.2`.

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading, ensure the following:

1. At least 2 GB of free storage for backup and update tasks.  
2. Upgrade your embedded or external MongoDB server to v5.0 or later. For more information, see the list of [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and follow the steps available on MongoDB official documentation to [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/).  
3. Create a backup of your Appsmith instance. For more information, see the [Backup instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl/#backup-instance) guide.

## Update Appsmith

Follow these steps to upgrade your Appsmith instance to checkpoint version `v1.9.2`.

<Tabs queryString="current-checkpoint-platform">

<TabItem label="Docker" value="docker">

These instructions are applicable to platforms using Docker, including Docker standalone, AWS AMI, or DigitalOcean.

1. Access your Appsmith installation directory and update the `docker-compose.yml` file:

2. Set the image attribute to use tag `v1.9.2`:  
      ```yaml  
      services:  
        appsmith:  
        # highlight-next-line
          image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2  
          container_name: appsmith  
      ``` 

3. Save the changes and restart the instance with the following command:  
    ```bash  
    docker-compose up -d  
    ```

4. Allow the instance to start and apply the necessary schema changes automatically. After the schema updates are complete, revert the image in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to the latest version:  
      ```yaml  
      services:  
        appsmith:  
        # highlight-next-line
          image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:latest 
          container_name: appsmith  
      ```   

4. Save the changes and restart the instance again to finalise the update:  
    ```bash  
    docker-compose up -d  
    ```

These instructions apply to platforms running Appsmith on Kubernetes.

### StatefulSets

1. List the StatefulSets in your Appsmith namespace:
    ```bash
    kubectl get sts -n <appsmith-namespace>
    ```

    Replace `<appsmith-namespace>` with your defined namespace.

2. Update the image of the StatefulSet to checkpoint version `v1.9.2`:
    ```bash
    kubectl set image sts/<appsmith> -n <appsmith-namespace> appsmith=appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
    ```

3. Pull and update Appsmith to version `v1.9.2`:
    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart sts/<appsmith> -n <appsmith-namespace>
    ```

4. Verify the update by checking the Appsmith apps.

5. Once the instance is stable, update to the latest version:
    ```bash
    kubectl set image sts/<appsmith> -n <appsmith-namespace> appsmith=appsmith/appsmith-ee:latest
    ```

6. Pull and update Appsmith to the latest version:
    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart sts/<appsmith> -n <appsmith-namespace>
    ```

### Deployments for high availability

1. List the Deployments in your Appsmith namespace:
    ```bash
    kubectl get deployments -n <appsmith-namespace>
    ```

    Note the Deployment name for Appsmith.

2. Update the Deployment image to checkpoint version `v1.9.2`:
    ```bash
    kubectl set image deployment/<appsmith> -n <appsmith-namespace> appsmith=appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
    ```

3. Once the instance is stable, update to the latest version:
    ```bash
    kubectl set image deployment/<appsmith> -n <appsmith-namespace> appsmith=appsmith/appsmith-ee:latest
    ```

<TabItem label="AWS ECS (EC2) and Fargate" value="aws-ecs-and-fargate">

These instructions apply to platforms running Appsmith on AWS ECS (EC2) and Fargate.

1. Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the Amazon ECS console.
2. Select the cluster containing the container instance to update.
3. Go to the task definition, and update the image tag to `v1.9.2`:
    ```bash
    appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
    ```
4. Restart the ECS service.
5. Verify the updated version is running successfully.
6. Go to the task definition, and update the image tag to `latest`:
    ```bash
    appsmith/appsmith-ee:latest
    ```
7. Restart the ECS service.
8. Verify the updated version is running successfully.
