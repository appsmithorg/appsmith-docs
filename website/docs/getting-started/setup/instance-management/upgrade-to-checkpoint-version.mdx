# Upgrade to checkpoint version v1.9.2

Checkpoint versions are milestone releases that ensure your Appsmith instance applies necessary database schema updates, optimizations, and compatibility fixes. If your current Appsmith version is older than `v1.9.2`, upgrading to this checkpoint version is mandatory before moving to later releases. This page provides step-by-step instructions to upgrade your self-hosted Appsmith instance to checkpoint version `v1.9.2`.

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading, ensure the following:

1. At least 2 GB of free storage for backup and update tasks.  
2. Upgrade your embedded or external MongoDB server to v5.0 or later. For more information, see the list of [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and follow the steps available on MongoDB official documentation to [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/).  
3. Create a backup of your Appsmith instance. For more information, see the [Backup instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl/#backup-instance) guide.

## Update instance

Follow these steps to upgrade your Appsmith instance to checkpoint version `v1.9.2`.

These instructions are applicable to platforms using Docker, including Docker standalone, AWS AMI, or DigitalOcean.

1. Access your Appsmith installation directory and modify the `docker-compose.yml` file:

    - For **Commercial Edition**, set the image to:  
      ```yaml  
      services:  
        appsmith:  
        # highlight-next-line
          image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2  
          container_name: appsmith  
      ``` 

    - For **Community Edition**, set the image to:  
      ```yaml  
      services:  
        appsmith:  
        # highlight-next-line
          image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce:v1.9.2  
          container_name: appsmith  
      ```  

2. Save the changes and restart the instance with the following command:  
    ```bash  
    docker-compose up -d  
    ```

3. Allow the instance to start and apply the necessary schema changes automatically. After the schema updates are complete, revert the image in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to the latest version:  

    - For **Commercial Edition**, set the image to:  
      ```yaml  
      services:  
        appsmith:  
        # highlight-next-line
          image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee  
          container_name: appsmith  
      ```  

    - For **Community Edition**, set the image to:  
      ```yaml  
      services:  
        appsmith:  
        # highlight-next-line
          image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce  
          container_name: appsmith  
      ```  

4. Save the changes and restart the instance again to finalize the update:  
    ```bash  
    docker-compose up -d  
    ```

These instructions apply to platforms running Appsmith on Kubernetes.

  #### Statefulsets

      1. List the StatefulSets in your Appsmith namespace:
          ```bash
          kubectl get sts -n <appsmith-namespace>
          ```

          Note the name of the StatefulSet for Appsmith.

      2. Update the image of the StatefulSet to checkpoint version `v1.9.2`:
          ```bash
          kubectl set image sts/<appsmith> -n <namespace> appsmith=appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
          ```

      3. Once the instance is running and stable, update to the latest version:
          ```bash
          kubectl set image sts/<appsmith> -n <namespace> appsmith=appsmith/appsmith-ee:latest
          ```

  #### Deployments using high availability

    1. List the Deployments in your Appsmith namespace:
        ```bash
        kubectl get deployments -n <appsmith-namespace>
        ```

        Note the name of the Deployment for Appsmith.

    2. Update the image of the Deployment to checkpoint version `v1.9.2`:
        ```bash
        kubectl set image deployment/<appsmith> -n <namespace> appsmith=appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
        ```

    3. Once the instance is running and stable, update to the latest version:
        ```bash
        kubectl set image deployment/<appsmith> -n <namespace> appsmith=appsmith/appsmith-ee:latest
        ```
