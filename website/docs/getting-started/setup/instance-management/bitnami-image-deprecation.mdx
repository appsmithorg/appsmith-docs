# Bitnami image deprecation (August 2025)

If you deploy Appsmith on Kubernetes using our Helm chart, a recent upstream change may affect your deployment.

Bitnami [announced](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267) that on August 28, 2025, many versioned images hosted at `docker.io/bitnami` will be moved to a read‑only `docker.io/bitnamilegacy` repository. Already‑packaged Bitnami Helm charts will remain available as OCI artifacts, but won’t work out‑of‑the‑box unless you override the bundled image repositories. Appsmith’s Helm chart includes Bitnami‑packaged images for the optional in‑cluster databases (MongoDB and PostgreSQL), so some deployments may be impacted.

Note: While the Appsmith chart does bundle Redis, Bitnami's Redis image was removed several versions ago.

## How do I know if I’m affected

This change affects only Kubernetes deployments installed with Helm that still use the in‑cluster databases from the chart’s default values. You are not affected if you:

- Use external/managed databases (for example, MongoDB Atlas or an external PostgreSQL) and have configured Appsmith to connect to them
- Deployed Appsmith on a platform other than Kubernetes
- Installed or reinstalled with a chart version that no longer relies on these Bitnami images (post‑August 2025 guidance)

To check your deployment, verify whether the MongoDB or PostgreSQL pods are using images from `docker.io/bitnami/*`.

1. Locate the namespace your deployment is running in and set it in an environment variable for reuse:

```
# Find the release and namespace
helm list -A | grep appsmith

# Example: set the namespace (replace with your actual namespace)
NAMESPACE=appsmith
```

If multiple namespaces are returned, repeat the following checks for each one.

2. Check if your deployment is using the default in‑cluster databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL):

```
kubectl get pods -n "$NAMESPACE"

# Example output
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
appsmith-0                   1/1     Running   3 (19d ago)   59d
appsmith-mongodb-0           1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-mongodb-1           1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-mongodb-arbiter-0   1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-postgresql-0        1/1     Running   0             22h
```

If you do not see pods named with `mongodb` or `postgresql`, you are likely not using the in‑cluster databases and can skip the rest.

If you do see these pods, check whether their images are pulled from `docker.io/bitnami`:

```
# MongoDB
kubectl get statefulset -n "$NAMESPACE" -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mongodb \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}{end}' | grep 'docker.io/bitnami/' || true

# PostgreSQL
kubectl get statefulset -n "$NAMESPACE" -l app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}{end}' | grep 'docker.io/bitnami/' || true

```

If any command returns an image reference from `docker.io/bitnami/...`, you should take action to avoid future image pull errors after August 28, 2025 (for example, `ImagePullBackOff`).

## What to do next

Before making any changes, take a backup. Then upgrade to the latest Appsmith Helm chart, at least version 3.6.4. This release updates the in‑cluster MongoDB and PostgreSQL image repositories to `docker.io/bitnamilegacy` to ensure continued pulls after August 28, 2025. Follow the Kubernetes steps here and target chart version 3.6.4: [Update Appsmith](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/update-appsmith?current-platform-type=kubernetes). After upgrading, re‑run the image checks above to confirm images reference `docker.io/bitnamilegacy/*`.

:::caution Important
Using the Bitnami Legacy images is a stopgap solution. We are still evaluating the best long‑term approach and will update this document when a decision is finalized. No action is required at this time beyond staying up to date with chart releases.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull` for Bitnami images post‑August 28, 2025, apply the short‑term workaround above to restore service, then plan a migration off legacy images. For further assistance, contact Appsmith support using the chat widget in the bottom‑right corner of this page.

You'll encounter issues similar to seeing this in the pod list:

```
pod/appsmith-ee-mongodb-0           0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0              21m
```

And when describing the pod you'll see something like this:

```
Warning  Failed     2s (x2 over 16s)  kubelet            Failed to pull image "docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:6.0.13": failed to pull and unpack image "docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:6.0.13": failed to resolve reference "docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:6.0.13": pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed
```
