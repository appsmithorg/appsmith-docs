# Bitnami image deprecation (August 2025)

If you deploy Appsmith on Kubernetes using our Helm chart, a recent upstream change may affect your deployment.

Bitnami [announced](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267) that on August 28, 2025, many versioned images hosted at `docker.io/bitnami` will be moved to a read‑only `docker.io/bitnamilegacy` repository. Appsmith’s Helm chart includes Bitnami‑packaged images for the optional in‑cluster databases (MongoDB and PostgreSQL), so some deployments will be impacted when a MongoDB or PostgreSQL pod is replaced during a node replacement or other cluster maintenance. *This can cause an outage of your Appsmith deployment.*

As of Appsmith Helm chart version 3.6.4, we are switching the defaults to use the `docker.io/bitnamilegacy` repositories. This is a stopgap solution while we evaluate options for a long-term solution for this change.

## How do I know if I’m affected

This change affects only Kubernetes deployments installed with Helm that still use the in‑cluster databases from the chart’s default values. You are not affected if you:

- Use external/managed databases (for example, MongoDB Atlas or an external PostgreSQL) and have configured Appsmith to connect to them
- Deployed Appsmith on a platform other than Kubernetes
- Installed or reinstalled with a chart version that no longer relies on these Bitnami images (post‑August 2025 guidance)

### Proactive check

To proactively check your deployment, verify whether the MongoDB or PostgreSQL pods are using images from `docker.io/bitnami/*`.

1. Locate the namespace your deployment is running in and set it in an environment variable for reuse:

```
# Find the release and namespace
helm list -A | grep appsmith

# Example: set the namespace (replace with your actual namespace)
NAMESPACE=appsmith
```

If multiple namespaces are returned, repeat the following checks for each one.

2. Check if your deployment is using the default in‑cluster databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL):

```
kubectl get pods -n "$NAMESPACE"

# Example output
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
appsmith-0                   1/1     Running   3 (19d ago)   59d
appsmith-mongodb-0           1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-mongodb-1           1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-mongodb-arbiter-0   1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-postgresql-0        1/1     Running   0             22h
```

If you do not see pods named with `mongodb` or `postgresql`, you are likely not using the in‑cluster databases and can skip the rest.

If you do see these pods, check whether their images are pulled from `docker.io/bitnami`:

```
# MongoDB
kubectl get statefulset -n "$NAMESPACE" -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mongodb \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}{end}' | grep 'docker.io/bitnami/' || true

# PostgreSQL
kubectl get statefulset -n "$NAMESPACE" -l app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}{end}' | grep 'docker.io/bitnami/' || true

```

If any command returns an image reference from `docker.io/bitnami/...`, you should take action to avoid future image pull errors after August 28, 2025 (for example, `ImagePullBackOff`).

### Deployment is broken (after August 28, 2025)

If your Appsmith deployment is currently down and shows MongoDB or PostgreSQL pods stuck with `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull` (post‑August 28, 2025), you are likely already affected.

Common symptoms:

- `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull` in `kubectl get pods` for MongoDB or PostgreSQL pods
- `Failed to pull image`, `pull access denied`, or `insufficient_scope: authorization failed` in `kubectl describe pod`

For example, your pod list might show:

```
pod/appsmith-ee-mongodb-0           0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0              21m
```

And `kubectl describe pod` might include:

```
Warning  Failed     2s (x2 over 16s)  kubelet            Failed to pull image "docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:6.0.13": failed to pull and unpack image "docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:6.0.13": failed to resolve reference "docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:6.0.13": pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed
```

If you are seeing something similar to the above, proceed to the next section to fix it.

## What to do next

- If your deployment is still functional, take a backup of the instance
- Upgrade to the latest Appsmith Helm chart version, at least 3.6.4. This release updates the in‑cluster MongoDB and PostgreSQL image repositories to `docker.io/bitnamilegacy` to ensure continued pulls after August 28, 2025. Follow the Kubernetes steps here: [Update Appsmith](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/update-appsmith?current-platform-type=kubernetes).
- After upgrading, re‑run the proactive image checks above to confirm images reference `docker.io/bitnamilegacy/*`.

If the deployment is still down and after performing the Helm upgrade, you may need to clear the current broken pod in the StatefulSet. Force a rollout of the MongoDB and PostgreSQL StatefulSets:

```
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/appsmith-ee-mongodb -n "$NAMESPACE"
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/appsmith-ee-mongodb-arbiter -n "$NAMESPACE"
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/appsmith-ee-postgresql -n "$NAMESPACE"
```
