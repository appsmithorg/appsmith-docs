# Bitnami Image Deprecation (August 2025)

If you deploy Appsmith on Kubernetes using our Helm chart, a recent upstream change may affect your deployment.

Bitnami has announced that on August 28, 2025, they will move many of their versioned container images — including MongoDB and PostgreSQL — to a read-only bitnamilegacy repository. While you may not be using Bitnami’s charts directly, by default the Appsmith Helm chart does include these images that are being moved.

## How do I know if I’m affected

This issue *only* affects Helm-based deployments on Kubernetes that use the default values from our Helm chart. Therefore, *you are unaffected if* you:

- Are using an external database and providing the credentials, utilizing services like MongoDB Atlas
- Have deployed Appsmith on a platform besides Kubernetes
- Have deployed via Helm after August 2025

To check your deployment to see if you are affected, we'll check the image that is used by your MongoDB and PostgreSQL pods currently.

1. Locate the namespace your deployment is running in:

```
kubectl get pod -A -l app.kubernetes.io/name=appsmith
NAMESPACE   NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
appsmith    appsmith-0   1/1     Running   3 (19d ago)   59d
```

If there are multiple values returned in the namespace field above, you'll need to update each one as you have multiple deployments of Appsmith.

2. Check if your deployment is using the default MongoDB or PostgreSQL option:

```
kubectl get pod -n appsmith
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
appsmith-0                   1/1     Running   3 (19d ago)   59d
appsmith-mongodb-0           1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-mongodb-1           1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-mongodb-arbiter-0   1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-postgresql-0        1/1     Running   0             22h
appsmith-redis-master-0      1/1     Running   2 (19d ago)   59d
appsmith-redis-replicas-0    1/1     Running   2 (19d ago)   59d
```

If you do not see pods named with `mongodb` or `postgresql` then you are *not affected* and can skip the rest.

If you do see pods from the above, check if you're using the affected image:

```
# MongoDB:
kubectl get statefulset -l app.kubernetes.io/component=mongodb -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}' --namespace appsmith-ee | grep docker.io/bitnami/mongodb
# PostgreSQL:
kubectl get statefulset -l app.kubernetes.io/component=primary -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}' --namespace appsmith-ee | grep docker.io/bitnami/postgresql
```

If either command returns an image, then you must take action to avoid downtime in the future.

## Updating the image value

Take a backup, and then follow the instructions for Kubernetes-based upgrades in our [documentation to deploy from the latest version of the Helm chart](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/update-appsmith?current-platform-type=kubernetes). Verify that the image was updated once the deployment is finished by utilizing the previous step.
