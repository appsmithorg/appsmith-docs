# Restore Database

This page explains how to restore the Appsmith internal database backup using the `appsmithctl` utility to recover your data.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- You need a self-hosted Appsmith instance up and running. If you haven’t installed Appsmith, refer to the [Installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides). This guide assumes you are working with an existing installation.
- Ensure you have at least 2 GB of free storage available to perform restore tasks.
- Access to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands, depending on your deployment setup.

## Restore database backup

Follow the appropriate instructions based on your deployment environment:

Follow these steps to restore Appsmith database backup for Docker-based installations:

1. Copy the backup file into the container:

   ```bash
   docker cp ./appsmith-data.archive appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/restore/
   ```

2. Import the backup data:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec appsmith appsmithctl import_db
   ```

3. Copy the `docker.env` file if it's not present in the installation folder:

   ```bash
   docker cp ./docker.env appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/configuration/
   ```

4. Restart the Appsmith server to apply changes:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec appsmith supervisorctl restart backend
   ```

<TabItem label="Kubernetes" value="kubernetes-commands">

Follow these steps to restore Appsmith database backup for Kubernetes installations:

1. Retrieve the name of the Appsmith pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

2. Copy the backup file into the pod. Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with the pod name:

   ```bash
   kubectl cp ./appsmith-data.archive ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME:/appsmith-stacks/data/restore/
   ```

3. Navigate to the `/appsmith-stacks/configuration/` folder and update the `docker.env` file with the following parameters:

   ```bash
   # The values generated and stored during the backup process
   APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
   APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT=APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT
   ```

4. Import the backup data. Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with the pod name:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME -- appsmithctl import_db
   ```

5. Restart the Appsmith pods based on your setup:

   - If autoscaling is **turned on**:

      ```bash
      kubectl rollout restart deployment appsmith
      ```

   - If autoscaling is **turned off**, or you’re using the Community Edition:

      ```bash
      kubectl rollout restart statefulset appsmith
      ```
