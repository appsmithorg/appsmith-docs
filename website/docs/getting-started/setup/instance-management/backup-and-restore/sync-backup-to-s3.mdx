You can sync Appsmith backups with an Amazon S3 bucket. This page explains how to sync Appsmith backups with an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

Before syncing backups to an S3 bucket, ensure the following:

- Your self-hosted Appsmith instance is running. If you havenâ€™t already installed Appsmith, refer to the [Installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides). This guide assumes you are working with an existing installation.
- You are on an [Appsmith paid plan](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).
- You have the Access Key, Secret Key, S3 bucket and AWS region information available with you.
- The S3 bucket is created and has read and write permissions assigned. For more information about S3 bucket policies, see [S3 Bucket Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-policies.html).

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">

<TabItem label="Docker" value="docker-commands">

1. Navigate to the directory containing the `docker.env` file.

2. Add the following environment variables to the `docker.env` file:

   ```javascript
   APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<aws_access_key>
   APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY=<aws_secret_key>
   APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket_name>
   APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_REGION=<aws_bucket_region>
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with the following:
      * `<aws_access_key>`: Your AWS access key.
      * `<aws_secret_key>`: Your AWS secret key.
      * `<bucket_name>`: The name of your S3 bucket.
      * `<aws_bucket_region>`: The region where your S3 bucket is hosted.

3. Run the following command to back up your instance and upload the backup to the configured S3 bucket:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec -it appsmith appsmithctl backup --upload-to-s3
   ```

Once the configuration is complete, the Appsmith instance and database backups can be restored from both local storage and the configured S3 bucket.

<TabItem label="Kubernetes" value="kubernetes-commands">

1. Open the values.yaml file in the Appsmith installation directory

2. Update the `applicationConfig` section in the `values.yaml` file:

     ```yaml
     applicationConfig:
       APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY: <aws_access_key>
       APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY: <aws_secret_key>
       APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_BUCKET_NAME: <bucket_name>
       APPSMITH_BACKUP_S3_REGION: <aws_bucket_region>
     ```
      Replace the placeholders with the following:
         * `<aws_access_key>`: Your AWS access key.
         * `<aws_secret_key>`: Your AWS secret key.
         * `<bucket_name>`: The name of your S3 bucket.
         * `<aws_bucket_region>`: The region where your S3 bucket is hosted.

3. Apply the updated values with the following command:

      ```bash
      helm upgrade appsmith appsmith/appsmith -f values.yaml
      ```

4. Use the following command to list the running pods:

      ```bash
      kubectl get pods
      ```

5. Sync backups to the S3 bucket by running the command:

      ```bash
      kubectl exec ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME -- appsmithctl backup --upload-to-s3
      ```
      Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with the name of your Appsmith pod.

Once the configuration is complete, the Appsmith instance and database backups can be restored from both local storage and the configured S3 bucket.

</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the sync process, consider the following:
- Backup files are not appearing in the S3 bucket.   
      - Verify that the AWS credentials in the configuration are correct.  
      - Check the Appsmith instance logs to ensure there are no permission issues. For more information, see [Get Container Logs](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/how-to-get-container-logs)  
- Unable to list backups from the S3 bucket after backup. 
      - Confirm that you are on an [Appsmith paid plan](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing), and your plan is active. For more information, see [License & plans](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/admin-settings#license--plans). 
      - Verify that the S3 bucket has appropriate permissions to list the backup archives from the bucket. 
      - Check the Appsmith instance logs to ensure there are no permission issues. For more information, see [Get Container Logs](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/how-to-get-container-logs)
