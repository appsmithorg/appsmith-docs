# Backup Database

When you create a backup of your Appsmith instance, it includes the database, configuration, and Git data. To back up your entire Appsmith instance, refer to the [Backup Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/backup-and-restore/backup-instance) guide. You may also choose to back up only the Appsmith data. This page explains how to back up Appsmith data specifically for your self-hosted Appsmith instance using the `appsmithctl` utility. 

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- Your self-hosted Appsmith instance is running. If you havenâ€™t already installed Appsmith, refer to the [Installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides). This guide assumes you are working with an existing installation.
- Ensure you have at least 2 GB of free storage available to perform backup tasks.
- Ensure you have the appropriate access to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands, depending on your deployment setup.

## Create database backup

Follow these steps to back up your Appsmith internal database:

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">
<TabItem label="Docker" value="docker-commands">

1. Go to the directory that has the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. Get your encryption details with:

      ```bash
      docker-compose exec -it appsmith cat /appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env | grep ENCRYPTION
      ```
      Store the encryption details securely, as you need them for restoring the Appsmith database.

3. Create a backup archive with:

      ```bash
      docker-compose exec -it appsmith appsmithctl export_db
      ```

      * Ensure that the name of the backup archive (`appsmith-data.archive`) isn't changed. 
      * The backup archive file is stored in the `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` folder in your container directory. You can access it at `./stacks/data/backup/` on your local machine.

4. If you can't access or have a different volume configuration, copy the archive file to your host disk with:

      ```bash
      docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive .
      ```
      This command copies the backup archive into your current directory.

5. To recreate the same environment elsewhere, copy the `docker.env` file with:

      ```bash
      docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env .
      ```
      This command copies the `docker.env` file into your current directory.

<TabItem label="Kubernetes" value="kubernetes-commands">

1. Get the name of the Appsmith pod with:

      ```bash
      kubectl get pods
      ```

2. Get your encryption details with:

      ```bash
      #highlight-next-line
      kubectl exec ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME -- cat /appsmith-stacks/configuration/docker.env | grep ENCRYPTION
      ```
      * Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with the pod name. 
      * Store the encryption details securely, as you need them for restoring the Appsmith database.

3. Create a database backup with:

      ```bash
      #highlight-next-line
      kubectl exec -it ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME appsmithctl export_db
      ```

      * Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with the pod name.
      * Ensure that the name of the backup archive (`appsmith-data.archive`) isn't changed. 
      * The archive file is stored in the container directory `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/`.

4. Copy the archive file with:

      ```bash
      #highlight-next-line
      kubectl cp ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive appsmith-data.archive
      ```
      Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with the pod name.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the restore process, consider the following:

- Verify that you have the required permissions to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands.
