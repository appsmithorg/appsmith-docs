# Backup Instance

When you create your Appsmith instance backup, a backup is created that includes database, configuration, and Git data. This page explains how to back up your self-hosted Appsmith instance using the `appsmithctl` utility.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- Your self-hosted Appsmith instance is running. If you havenâ€™t already installed Appsmith, refer to the [Installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides). This guide assumes you are working with an existing installation.
- Ensure you have at least 2 GB of free storage available to perform backup tasks.
- Ensure you have the appropriate access to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands, depending on your deployment setup.

## Create instance backup

You can create a backup archive of your Appsmith instance, including the database, `docker.env`, and Git data. Follow the steps below based on your deployment environment:

<Tabs queryString="current-command-type">

<TabItem label="Docker" value="docker-commands">

1. Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. Create a backup archive with encryption by running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec -it appsmith appsmithctl backup
   ```

   - When prompted, enter a password for encryption and ensure you remember it. This password is required to restore the backup.
   - The backup file is saved in `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/` in the container. On your local machine, you can find it at `./stacks/data/backup/`.

3. If you cannot access the backup file or have a different volume configuration, copy the archive file to your host disk:

   ```bash
   docker cp appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-backup-DATE_AND_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.enc .
   ```
   Replace `appsmith-backup-DATE_AND_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.enc` with the backup file name. After completing this step, the backup archive will be available in your current directory.

<TabItem label="Kubernetes" value="kubernetes-commands">

1. Retrieve the name of the Appsmith pod (replace `APPSMITH_NAMESPACE` with your namespace):

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n APPSMITH_NAMESPACE
   ```

2. Create a backup archive with encryption by running:

   ```bash
   # Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with your Appsmith pod name
   kubectl exec -it ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME -- appsmithctl backup
   ```

   - When prompted, enter a password for encryption and ensure you remember it. This password is required to restore the backup.
   - The backup file is stored in `/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/`.

3. Copy the backup file to your local machine:

   ```bash
   kubectl cp ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/APPSMITH_BACKUP_FILENAME -n APPSMITH_NAMESPACE LOCAL_BACKUP_FILENAME
   ```

   Replace placeholders in capitals with appropriate values. After completing this step, the backup archive will be available in your current directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the restore process, consider the following:

- Verify that you have the required permissions to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands.
