# Restore Instance

This page explains how to restore your self-hosted Appsmith instance backup using the `appsmithctl` utility.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- Your self-hosted Appsmith instance is running. If you haven’t already installed Appsmith, refer to the [Installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides). This guide assumes you are working with an existing installation.
- Ensure you have at least 2 GB of free storage available to perform restore tasks.
- Ensure that you have the appropriate access to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands, depending on your deployment setup.
- Verify that the backup archive file you want to restore is available.

## Restore instance backup

Follow the appropriate instructions based on your deployment environment:

Follow these steps to restore your Appsmith instance for Docker-based installations:

1. Restore the Appsmith instance:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec -it appsmith appsmithctl restore
   ```

   The command lists available backup archives, with the latest appearing at the bottom.

2. Select a backup archive from the list to restore.

   :::caution Attention
   If you are restoring an older version of Appsmith, a warning message may appear. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file with the Appsmith image version you wish to restore.
   :::

3. Copy the backup archive file:

   ```bash
   docker cp appsmith-backup-TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.enc appsmith:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/
   ```
4. Decide how to handle encryption during the restore process.

   - **Using existing encryption keys**: You can only use existing encryption keys, if you are restoring the backup to the **same Appsmith container** that generated it.  
     - When prompted, press `Enter` to reuse the same encryption keys, or type `n` if you wish to manually provide the original encryption key and salt. You may see the following prompt in your terminal:

       ```bash
       If you are restoring to the same Appsmith deployment which generated the backup archive, you can use the existing encryption keys on the instance.
       Press Enter to continue with existing encryption keys
       Or Type "n"/"No" to provide encryption key & password corresponding to the original Appsmith instance that is being restored.
       n
       Enter the APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD: *************
       Enter the APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT: *************
       ```

   - **Providing new encryption keys**: If you are restoring the backup to a **different Appsmith container**, you must provide new encryption details. To do this, navigate to the `/appsmith-stacks/configuration/` folder and update the `docker.env` file with the following parameters:

       ```bash
       # The values generated and stored during the backup process
       APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=<replace-with-encryption-password>
       APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT=<replace-with-encryption-salt>
       ```

       Replace the placeholders with the actual encryption values used during the backup process:
       - `<replace-with-encryption-password>`: The encryption password.  
       - `<replace-with-encryption-salt>`: The encryption salt.

Follow these steps to restore your Appsmith instance for Kubernetes-based installations:

1. Retrieve the name of the Appsmith pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

2. Copy the backup archive file to the pod. Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with the pod name:

     ```bash
     kubectl cp appsmith-backup-TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.enc ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/
     ```

3. Decide how to handle encryption during the restore process.

   - **Using existing encryption keys**: You can only use existing encryption keys, if you are restoring the backup to the **same Appsmith container** that generated it.  
     - When prompted, press `Enter` to reuse the same encryption keys, or type `n` if you wish to manually provide the original encryption key and salt. You may see the following prompt in your terminal:

       ```bash

       Press Enter to continue with existing encryption keys
       Or Type "n"/"No" to provide encryption key & password corresponding to the original Appsmith instance that is being restored.
       n
       Enter the APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD: *************
       Enter the APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT: *************
       ```

   - **Providing new encryption keys**: If you are restoring the backup to a **different Appsmith container**, you must provide new encryption details. To do this, navigate to the `/appsmith-stacks/configuration/` folder and update the `docker.env` file with the following parameters:

       ```bash
       # The values generated and stored during the backup process
       APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=<replace-with-encryption-password>
       APPSMITH_ENCRYPTION_SALT=<replace-with-encryption-salt>
       ```
       Replace the placeholders with the actual encryption values used during the backup process:
       - `<replace-with-encryption-password>`: The encryption password.  
       - `<replace-with-encryption-salt>`: The encryption salt.  

4. Restore the backup. Replace `ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME` with the pod name:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it ANY_APPSMITH_POD_NAME -- appsmithctl restore
   ```

5. Restart the Appsmith pods based on your setup:

   - If autoscaling is **turned on**:

     ```bash
     kubectl rollout restart deployment appsmith
     ```

   - If autoscaling is **turned off**, or you’re using the Community Edition:

     ```bash
     kubectl rollout restart statefulset appsmith
     ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the restore process, consider the following:

- Ensure you've copied the backup archive to the correct folder within the container or pod.
- Ensure the S3 bucket has appropriate permissions to list the backup archives from the bucket.
- Verify that you are on an [Appsmith paid plan](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing) and your plan is active to list backup archives from S3 bucket. For more information, see [License & plans](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/admin-settings#license--plans).
- Verify that you have the required permissions to execute `docker-compose` or `kubectl` commands.
- If using encrypted backups, confirm that the encryption password and salt match the original values used during backup creation.
- If restarting the pods fails, check the logs for errors. For more information, see [Get Container logs](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/how-to-get-container-logs) guide.
