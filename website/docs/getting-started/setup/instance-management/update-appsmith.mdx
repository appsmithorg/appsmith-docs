2. Update your embedded or external MongoDB server to version 5.0 or later. Refer to the [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and follow the [MongoDB Replica Set Upgrade Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/).  
3. Create a backup of your Appsmith instance. Follow the [Backup instance guide](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl/#backup-instance).

:::

1. Locate your Appsmith installation directory by running:  
   ```bash
   docker inspect -f '{{ (index .Mounts 0).Source }}' <APPSMITH_CONTAINER_ID>
   ``` 
2. Pull the latest Appsmith image and restart the container:

The following works if you followed the steps in the install guide exactly. If you changed things like Helm release name, namespace, etc. then your exact commands may vary. Make any substitutions where they apply in the instructions below.

1. Retrieve the latest version from GitHub [here](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/releases).
2. Locate your Helm installation's values file:
   - If you have your values.yaml fom when you first [installed Appsmith](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/kubernetes), navigate to that folder using the `cd` command.
   - If you no longer have your values.yaml, you can retrieve it from the cluster with this command:
   ```bash
   helm get values appsmith-ee -n appsmith-ee | grep -v "USER-SUPPLIED" > values.yaml
   ```
3. Edit values.yaml to specify the new version.
   If you have `yq` installed, you can use it:
   ```bash
   APPSMITH_VERSION=<version>
   yq -i ".image.tag = \"$APPSMITH_VERSION\"" values.yaml
   ```
   If you do not have `yq` installed locally, edit values.yaml with your preferred editor. You want to change the `image.tag` value like:
   ```bash
   image:
     tag: <version>
   ```
4. Apply the changes with:
     ```bash
     helm upgrade appsmith-ee -n appsmith-ee -f values.yaml
     ```
