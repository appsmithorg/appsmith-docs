# Update Appsmith

This page provides steps to update Appsmith to the latest version on your self-hosted Appsmith instance. The steps can be followed for both Community and Business editions.

## Prerequisites

Before you update Appsmith, make sure you have:

* At least 2 GB of free storage space for backup and update tasks.
* Created a backup of the Appsmith instance. If not yet backed up Appsmith, see [Backup Appsmith Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl/#backup-instance) guide. (_Recommended_)
* Upgraded your embedded or custom MongoDB server to MongoDB v5 or later. If you haven't upgraded yet, see the list of [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and follow the steps to [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/).

## Upgrade to checkpoint version

A checkpoint version is a milestone release that ensures a proper application of any necessary database schema changes, optimizations, or other updates to prevent any compatibility issues or data inconsistencies. The available Appsmith checkpoint versions are as follows:

  * `v1.9.2`

Follow these steps on your platform to update to the checkpoint version `v1.9.2`:

1. Access your Appsmith instance and change the image attribute in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to the checkpoint version `v1.9.2`:
    * When running the **Appsmith Community Edition** on Docker, update the image name as shown below:
        ```yaml
        services:
          appsmith:
            #highlight-next-line
            image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce:v1.9.2
            container_name: appsmith
        ```
    * When running the **Appsmith Business Edition** on Docker, update the image name as shown below:
        ```yaml
        services:
          appsmith:
            #highlight-next-line
            image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
            container_name: appsmith
        ```
2. Save the changes, and restart Appsmith instance with:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

3. The server starts with the older version, and applies all the necessary schema changes to your Appsmith instance. Once completed, switch back to the original image version in the `docker-compose.yml` file and resume normal operations.
    * When running the **Appsmith Community Edition** on Docker, update the image name as shown below:
        ```yaml
        services:
        appsmith:
          #highlight-next-line
          image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
          container_name: appsmith
        ```
    * When running the **Appsmith Business Edition** on Docker, update the image name as shown below:
        ```yaml
        services:
          appsmith:
            #highlight-next-line
            image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
            container_name: appsmith
        ```
4. Save the changes and restart Appsmith instance with: 
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

If you haven't updated Appsmith for a while, you may have to update to multiple versions. In such case, follow the same steps for each version starting from the oldest. For a complete list of releases, see [Appsmith releases](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/releases).

## Update Docker installation

Before you begin with the Appsmith update, ensure that all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are met and that your current version is v1.9.2 or later. If you're not on this version, see the [Upgrade to checkpoint version](#upgrade-to-checkpoint-version) guide.

Follow these steps to update Appsmith, these instructions can be used to update Appsmith on any platform that supports Docker. For example, Docker, AWS AMI, or DigitalOcean.

1. Go to the Appsmith installation directory. If you don't know the directory, find it with:

  ```bash
  docker inspect -f '{{ (index .Mounts 0).Source }}' <APPSMITH_CONTAINER_ID>
  ```
2. Update the Appsmith installation to a latest version with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose pull && docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && docker-compose up -d
  ```
The above command, pulls the latest image of Appsmith, and updates the installation after restarting the Docker container.

You may choose to schedule automatic updates for your Appsmith Docker installation. For more information, see [Schedule Automatic Updates].
