# Upgrade Appsmith Versions

This page provides step-by-step instructions to update Appsmith to the latest version on your self-hosted instance.

## Prerequisites

Before updating, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. At least 2 GB of free storage for backup and update tasks.  
2. Update your embedded or external MongoDB server to version 5.0 or later. Refer to the [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and follow the [MongoDB Replica Set Upgrade Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/).  
3. Create a backup of your Appsmith instance. Follow the [Backup instance guide](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl/#backup-instance).

:::

1. Locate your Appsmith installation directory by running:  
   ```bash
   docker inspect -f '{{ (index .Mounts 0).Source }}' <APPSMITH_CONTAINER_ID>
   ``` 
2. Pull the latest Appsmith image and restart the container:  
   ```bash

:::caution Important
If your current version is older than v1.9.2. Refer to the [Upgrade to Checkpoint Version (v1.9.2)](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/upgrade-to-checkpoint-version) guide before updating Appsmith to the latest release.  
:::

> **Note**: The following instructions assume you followed our [Kubernetes install guide](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/kubernetes) exactly. If you made changes—such as using a different Helm release name, namespace, etc.—you’ll need to adjust the commands accordingly.

1. Retrieve the latest Appsmith version
   
Find the latest release version on [GitHub](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/releases).

2. Locate your Helm `values.yaml` file
   - If you still have the `values.yaml` file from your initial installation, navigate to its directory:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/values-file
     ```
   - If you no longer have the file, you can retrieve it from your cluster:
     ```bash
     helm get values appsmith-ee -n appsmith-ee | grep -v "USER-SUPPLIED" > values.yaml
     ```

3. Update the image tag in `values.yaml`
   - If you have [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) installed:
     ```bash
     APPSMITH_VERSION=<version>
     yq -i ".image.tag = \"$APPSMITH_VERSION\"" values.yaml
     ```
   - If you don’t have `yq`, manually edit `values.yaml` with your preferred text editor to set the new version:
     ```yaml
     image:
       tag: <version>
     ```

4. Apply the upgrade using Helm
   
Run the following command to upgrade your Appsmith installation:
   ```bash
   helm upgrade appsmith-ee -n appsmith-ee -f values.yaml
   ```

<TabItem label="AWS ECS on EC2" value="aws-ecs-ec2">

1. Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the Amazon ECS console.  
2. Select the cluster containing the container instance to update.  
3. Stop the task and allow the system to deploy a new task automatically.  
4. Verify the updated version is running successfully.

<TabItem label="Azure Container Instance" value="azure-ci">

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the Azure Container Instance running Appsmith.  
2. Restart the container by clicking the **Restart** button.

If your current version is older than v1.9.2. Refer to the [Upgrade to Checkpoint Version (v1.9.2)](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/upgrade-to-checkpoint-version) guide before updating Appsmith to the latest release.  
:::

1. SSH into your droplet and navigate to the Appsmith installation directory:  

   ```bash
   cd /root/appsmith
   ```  
2. Pull the latest image and restart the installation:
