This page provides steps to update Appsmith to the latest version on your self-hosted Appsmith instance.

## System requirements

* Upgrade your embedded or external MongoDB server to MongoDB v5 or later. See the list of [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and follow the steps to [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/).

## Update on Docker

Before you begin the Appsmith update, ensure you have met all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), and your current Appsmith version is v1.9.2 or later. If you're not on this version, see the [Upgrade to checkpoint version](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/upgrade-to-checkpoint-version) guide.

Follow these steps to update Appsmith, use these instructions to update Appsmith on any platform that supports Docker (Docker, AWS AMI, or DigitalOcean).

1. Go to the Appsmith installation directory. If you don't know the directory, find it with:

  ```bash
  docker inspect -f '{{ (index .Mounts 0).Source }}' <APPSMITH_CONTAINER_ID>
  ```
2. Update the Appsmith installation to the latest version with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose pull && docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && docker-compose up -d
  ```
The above command pulls the latest image of Appsmith and updates the installation after restarting the Docker container.
