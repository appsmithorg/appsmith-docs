# Update Appsmith

This page provides steps to update Appsmith to the latest version on your self-hosted Appsmith instance.

## Prerequisites

* At least 2 GB of free storage space for backup and update tasks.

## Before you begin

* Create a backup of the Appsmith instance, See [Backup Appsmith Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl/#backup-instance) guide. (_Recommended_)
* Upgrade your embedded or external MongoDB server to MongoDB v5 or later. See the list of [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and follow the steps to [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/).

## Upgrade to checkpoint version

A checkpoint version is a milestone release that ensures a proper application of any necessary database schema changes, optimisations, or other updates to prevent compatibility issues or data inconsistencies. When performing a manual upgrade, you first need to upgrade to a checkpoint version if your Appsmith installation version is prior to `v1.9.2`. The available Appsmith checkpoint versions are as follows:

  * `v1.9.2`

### Docker
Before you update to a checkpoint version, ensure you have met all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites). Follow these steps to update to the checkpoint version `v1.9.2`. You can use these instructions to update Appsmith on any platform that supports Docker (Docker, AWS AMI, or DigitalOcean).

1. Access your Appsmith instance and change the image attribute in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to the checkpoint version `v1.9.2`:
    * If you are on the **Community Edition** on Docker, update the image name as shown below:
        ```yaml
        services:
          appsmith:
            #highlight-next-line
            image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce:v1.9.2
            container_name: appsmith
        ```
    * If you are on the **Business Edition** on Docker, update the image name as shown below:
        ```yaml
        services:
          appsmith:
            #highlight-next-line
            image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
            container_name: appsmith
        ```
2. Save the changes, and restart the Appsmith instance with:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
3. The server starts with the older version and applies all the necessary schema changes to your Appsmith instance. Once completed, switch back to the original image version in the `docker-compose.yml` file and resume normal operations.
    * If you are on the **Community Edition** on Docker, update the image name as shown below:
        ```yaml
        services:
        appsmith:
          #highlight-next-line
          image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
          container_name: appsmith
        ```
    * If you are on the **Business Edition** on Docker, update the image name as shown below:
        ```yaml
        services:
          appsmith:
            #highlight-next-line
            image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
            container_name: appsmith
        ```
4. Save the changes and restart the Appsmith instance with: 
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

If you haven't updated Appsmith for a while, you may have to update to multiple versions. In such a case, perform the same steps for each version in order, starting from the oldest. For a complete list of releases, see [Appsmith releases](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/releases).

## Update on Docker

Before you begin the Appsmith update, ensure you have met all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), and your current Appsmith version is v1.9.2 or later. If you're not on this version, see the [Upgrade to checkpoint version](#upgrade-to-checkpoint-version) guide.

Follow these steps to update Appsmith, these instructions can be used to update Appsmith on any platform that supports Docker (Docker, AWS AMI, or DigitalOcean).

1. Go to the Appsmith installation directory. If you don't know the directory, find it with:

  ```bash
  docker inspect -f '{{ (index .Mounts 0).Source }}' <APPSMITH_CONTAINER_ID>
  ```
2. Update the Appsmith installation to the latest version with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose pull && docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && docker-compose up -d
  ```
The above command pulls the latest image of Appsmith and updates the installation after restarting the Docker container.

You may choose to schedule automatic updates for your Appsmith Docker installation. For more information, see [Schedule Automatic Updates for Docker installation](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/maintenance-window#docker).

## Update on Kubernetes

Before you begin the update, ensure you have met all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites). Follow these steps to update Appsmith:

* If you are on the **Community Edition**, update the installation to the latest release with:

  ```bash
  kubectl rollout restart statefulset appsmith
  ```
* If you are on the **Business Edition**, update the Appsmith container image to the latest release with: 

  ```bash
  kubectl rollout restart deployment appsmith
  ```
You may choose to schedule automatic updates for your Appsmith Kubernetes installation. For more information, see [Schedule Automatic Updates for Kubernetes installation](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/maintenance-window#kubernetes ).

## Update on AWS ECS EC2

Before you begin the update, ensure you have met all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites). Follow the below steps using the Classic Amazon Web Console to update Appsmith:

1. Log in to your [AWS account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/).
2. Go to the **Amazon ECS console**.
3. Choose the **cluster** that has the container instance you wish to update.
4. Click the **Tasks** tab.
5. Select and click the **task** you wish to update. 
6. Click the **Stop** button to stop the task. Wait for the automatic deployment of a new task to be completed.
7. Verify that the updated version of your application is running as expected.

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors, roll back to a previous version to fix the issue. For more information, see the [Restore Appsmith instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#restore-instance) section.
