# Update Appsmith
This page provides steps to update Appsmith to the latest version.

:::info
The steps below apply to both the Community and Business editions.
:::

## Prerequisites
Before you start the update process, make sure you complete the below steps:

* Ensure you have at least 2 GB of free storage space for backup and update tasks.
* You can create a backup of the Appsmith instance before a manual update. For more information, see [Backup Appsmith Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#backup-appsmith-instance) (_Recommended_)

:::caution Attention
If you are on a version earlier than v1.9.2, first upgrade:
   * Your Embedded or Custom MongoDB server to use MongoDB v5. See the list of [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/) once your infrastructure is in place.
   * Follow the steps in the [Upgrade to a Checkpoint version](#upgrade-to-a-checkpoint-version) section to update Appsmith.
:::

## Docker Compose
The steps below work with any platform that supports Docker. For example, Docker, AWS AMI, or DigitalOcean.

You can update Appsmith in one of the following ways:

* [Manual update](#manual-update)
* [Automatic update](#automatic-update)

:::info
To find the Appsmith installation directory, run the following command:

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{ (index .Mounts 0).Source }}' <APPSMITH_CONTAINER_ID>
```
:::

### Manual update
Go to the root directory of your installation and run:

```bash
docker-compose pull && docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && docker-compose up -d
```

### Automatic update

Follow the below steps to turn on the auto updates:

:::info
Before an automatic update, Appsmith creates a backup. You may use this to roll back to a previous version in case of any issues.
:::

1. Go to the root directory of the Appsmith installation and run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and uncomment the below code block:
   
   ```yaml
   #auto_update:
   #  image: containrrr/watchtower
   #  volumes:
   #    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
   #  # Update check interval in seconds.
   #  command: --schedule "0 0 * ? * *" --label-enable --cleanup
   #  restart: unless-stopped
   #  depends_on:
   #    - appsmith
   #  environment:
   #    - WATCHTOWER_LIFECYCLE_HOOKS=true
   ```

3. Save the file and run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This setup runs an Appsmith and a Watchtower container. The Watchtower checks and updates Appsmith when a new version becomes available. 

You may also schedule automatic updates for your instance. For more information, see [Configure auto-updates](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/maintenance-window#adding-a-configurable-maintenance-window-for-appsmiths-auto-updates).

## Upgrade to a checkpoint version

When performing a manual upgrade, you must:

* First, upgrade to the checkpoint between your current and the latest versions.
* Appsmith checkpoint versions:
  * v1.9.2

Follow the steps below to upgrade to a checkpoint version:

1. Access your Appsmith instance. Make the below change to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>

```yaml
services:
  appsmith:
    #highlight-next-line
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce:v1.9.2
    container_name: appsmith
```

</TabItem>
   <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">

```yaml
services:
  appsmith:
    #highlight-next-line
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
    container_name: appsmith
```
   
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Save and run the below command on your shell to restart Appsmith.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Your server starts with the older version. It applies all the necessary schema changes to your Appsmith instance. Once completed, switch back to the original image in the `docker-compose.yml` file and resume normal operations.

<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>

  ```yaml
  services:
  appsmith:
    #highlight-next-line
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">

  ```yaml
  services:
    appsmith:
      #highlight-next-line
      image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
      container_name: appsmith
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

4. Run the restart command once again: 

 ```bash
 docker-compose up -d
 ```
 
 
:::note 
If you haven't been using your Appsmith instance for a while, it could be possible that there might be multiple versions that show up in the error message. In such a case, perform the same steps for each version in order, starting from the oldest.

## Troubleshooting

If you see deployment errors, you can roll back to a previous version to fix the issue. For more information, see the [Restore Appsmith instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#restore-appsmith-instance) section. 

If you continue to face issues, contact the [support team](mailto:support@appsmith.com).
