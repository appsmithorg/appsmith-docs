# Update Appsmith
This page provides steps to update Appsmith to the latest version.

:::info
The steps below apply to both the Community and Business editions.
:::

## Prerequisites
Before you start the update process, make sure you complete the below steps:

* Ensure you have at least 2 GB of free storage space for backup and update tasks.
* You can create a backup of the Appsmith instance before a manual update. For more information, see [Backup Appsmith Instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#backup-appsmith-instance) (_Recommended_)

:::caution Attention
If you are on a version earlier than v1.9.2, first upgrade:
   * Your Embedded or Custom MongoDB server to use MongoDB v5. See the list of [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support) and [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/) once your infrastructure is in place.
   * Follow the steps listed in the [Upgrade to a Checkpoint version](#upgrade-to-a-checkpoint-version) section to update Appsmith.
:::

## Docker Compose
The steps below work with any platform that supports Docker. For example, Docker, AWS AMI, or DigitalOcean.

You can update Appsmith in one of the following ways:

* [Manual update](#manual-update)
* [Automatic update](#automatic-update)

:::info
To find the Appsmith installation directory, run the following command:

```
docker inspect -f '{{ (index .Mounts 0).Source }}' <APPSMITH_CONTAINER_ID>
```
:::

### Manual update
Go to the root directory of your installation and run:

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && docker-compose up -d
```

### Automatic update

Follow the below steps to turn on the auto updates:

:::info
Before an automatic update, Appsmith creates a backup. You may use this to roll back to a previous version in case of any issues.
:::

1. Go to the root directory of the Appsmith installation and run:

   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and uncomment the below code block:
   
   ```yaml
   #auto_update:
   #  image: containrrr/watchtower
   #  volumes:
   #    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
   #  # Update check interval in seconds.
   #  command: --schedule "0 0 * ? * *" --label-enable --cleanup
   #  restart: unless-stopped
   #  depends_on:
   #    - appsmith
   #  environment:
   #    - WATCHTOWER_LIFECYCLE_HOOKS=true
   ```

3. Save the file and run:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

When the server restarts, Appsmith updates to the latest version. This setup runs an Appsmith and a Watchtower container. The Watchtower checks and updates Appsmith when a new version becomes available. 

You may also schedule automatic updates for your instance. For more information, see [Configure auto-updates](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/maintenance-window#adding-a-configurable-maintenance-window-for-appsmiths-auto-updates).

## Kubernetes
Business - 
#### Update Appsmith

Appsmith installation can be updated manually or by enabling auto update.

##### Auto update

The default Appsmith helm installation disables auto update (_recommended_). You have an option to enable auto update by either:
  - Running the command below.
    ```
    helm upgrade --set autoupdate.enabled=true \
    appsmith [appsmith-ee|appsmith]/appsmith 
    ```
  - Or edit `values.yaml` and specify the following parameters
    ```yaml
    autoupdate.enabled: true
    autoupdate.scheduler: 0
    ```
    Followed by running the command below.
    ```bash
    helm upgrade --values values.yaml appsmith [appsmith-ee|appsmith]/appsmith
    ```

##### Manual update

To manually update the Appsmith container image to the latest release, run the command: 

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment appsmith
```
Community - 
#### Update Appsmith

Appsmith installation can be updated manually or by enabling auto update.

##### Auto update

The default Appsmith helm installation disables auto update (_recommended_). You have an option to enable auto update by either setting it in values file or using a command.

* Values file: Ensure that the parameters are configured to enable auto update. For more information, see [Auto update image](#auto-update-image). Once the set up is in place, run the below command.

   ```
     helm upgrade --values values.yaml appsmith appsmith/appsmith
    ```

* Command: Pass an argument using the `--set` keyword (`--set autoupdate.enabled=true`) to the command.

    ```
      helm install appsmith/appsmith appsmith \
        --set autoupdate.enabled=true
    ```

##### Manual update

To manually update the Appsmith container image to the latest release, run the command: 

```bash
kubectl rollout restart statefulset appsmith
```

## Upgrade to a checkpoint version

When you upgrade manually, you must upgrade to the checkpoint version released between your version and the latest version.

Appsmith checkpoint versions:
* v1.9.2

Access your Appsmith instance and make the below change to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>
  
From:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
    container_name: appsmith
```

To:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce:v1.9.2
    container_name: appsmith
```


</TabItem>
   <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">
   
From:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
    container_name: appsmith
```

To:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
    container_name: appsmith
```
   
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Save and run the below command on your shell to restart Appsmith.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Your server starts with the older version that makes all the necessary schema changes to your Appsmith instance. Once this process has been completed successfully (you can verify this by logging in to your Appsmith instance), you can return to the original version of your `docker-compose.yml` file and resume normal operations.


<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>

  ```bash
  services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">

  ```
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Run the restart command once again: 

 ```
 docker-compose up -d
  ```
:::note 
If you haven't been using your Appsmith instance for a while, it could be possible that there might be multiple versions that show up in the error message. In such a case, perform the same steps for each version in order, starting from the oldest.

## Troubleshooting

If you see deployment errors, you can roll back to a previous version to fix the issue. For more information, see the [Restore Appsmith instance](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/appsmithctl#restore-appsmith-instance) section. 

If you continue to face issues, contact the [support team](mailto:support@appsmith.com).
