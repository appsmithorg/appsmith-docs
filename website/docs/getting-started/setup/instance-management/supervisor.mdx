# Monitor Subsystems

Appsmith uses Supervisor to manage and monitor key subsystems, including the Appsmith server, Caddy, and MongoDB. If a subsystem becomes unresponsive, Supervisor attempts to restart it automatically. If the [Health Check API](/getting-started/setup/instance-management/api-reference) fails, you can use Supervisor to diagnose and manage subsystems.


You can monitor and manage processes using either the Web Interface or the Command Line Interface (CLI).

  <TabItem label="Web Interface" value="web">

    The Supervisor Web Interface provides an easy-to-use, graphical way to monitor and manage Appsmith processes. Follow the steps below to configure and access the web interface.

    1. Go to the `docker.env` file located in the `stacks/configuration` folder.
    2. Add the following environment variables to set the Supervisor credentials:

      <dd>
         ```bash
        APPSMITH_SUPERVISOR_USER=<SUPERVISOR-USER>
        APPSMITH_SUPERVISOR_PASSWORD=<SUPERVISOR-PASSWORD>
        ```

        If these variables are not set, you must create a new Supervisor user by manually defining a username and password in the docker.env file. Supervisor uses these credentials for authentication when accessing the web interface.

      </dd>

    3. Save the file and restart your Appsmith instance for the changes to take effect.

    3. You can access the Supervisor web interface at `http://[your-domain]/supervisor`. For example, if your Appsmith instance is available at `http://localhost`, the Supervisor web interface can be accessed at `http://localhost/supervisor`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Command Line Interface" value="commandline">

    The Supervisor Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a way to interact with and manage processes directly from the terminal. Follow the steps below to monitor the processes using the CLI.

    1. To check the status of all running processes, use the following command:
      
      <dd>

        ```bash
        docker-compose exec appsmith supervisorctl status
        ```
      This lists all managed processes along with their current state (e.g., `RUNNING`, `STOPPED`, `FATAL`).


      </dd>

    2. To view the last few lines of the `stderr` output of a specific process, use:

      <dd>

        ```bash
        docker-compose exec appsmith supervisorctl tail <process_name> stderr
        ```

        Replace `<process_name>` with the name of the process you want to check. You can get the process name from the `supervisorctl` status command output.  

       </dd>

    For a complete list of `supervisorctl` commands, refer to the [Supervisor official documentation](http://supervisord.org/running.html#supervisorctl-actions).

## Troubleshooting

If resource usage exceeds defined thresholds or you face deployment issues, capture relevant monitoring screenshots. Refer to the [troubleshooting guide](/help-and-support/troubleshooting-guide/deployment-errors) for common errors. If the issue persists, contact Appsmith Support using the chat widget at the bottom right and provide the screenshots for further diagnostics.
