# FAQ

## What kind of apps can I build on Appsmith?

You can use Appsmith to build custom forms, admin panels, dashboards and other complex workflows. Apps like database GUIs, customer support tools, back office apps, approval apps, and tracking/monitoring tools and management systems are all prime use cases for Appsmith. You can also use it as a clean UI layer over manually triggered scripts, confusing deployment pipelines and basic database CRUD operations. There's little preventing you from using Appsmith to bring any idea to life, and the product is optimized to make building internal tools a hassle-free experience.

## How is Appsmith different from other no-code or low-code tools?

Appsmith is the first open source platform for building internal tools which means unlimited apps and users. Appsmith gives you building blocks (widgets and queries) that you can configure and connect using JavaScript. This ensures that you never get blocked trying to create a custom workflow, and don't spend time building repetitive components. Appsmith supports version control using Git to build apps in collaboration using branches to track and roll back changes. You can also self-host Appsmith on your local machine or a hosting platform giving you complete control over your data privacy, security, and integrity.

## What are the platform limitations?

Internal apps are our current focus area. Appsmith isn't built for complicated UI interactions that are common to e-commerce or other consumer-facing websites. It works great for tools and workflows internal to your team or organization, but not if you are trying to build an attractive consumer website.

## How secure is Appsmith?

Appsmith applications are secure-by-default. See [Security](/product/security) for more information. For Appsmith cloud users, data is stored and processed on servers in the US. If you want to have complete control over how your data is stored and transmitted, or need to ensure HIPAA compliance, you can [self-host Appsmith](/getting-started/setup) to ensure none of your data leaves your VPC.

We appreciate any information that can help improve the security of our systems and protect users' data. We do reward security researchers who report serious and previously undiscovered issues. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please email our security team at security@appsmith.com with a description of the issue and any relevant details. After reviewing the report, appropriate action is taken to address the issue.

## Does Appsmith support multi-user editing?

Appsmith is currently built for a single-user editor experience. If you try to update the same page/widget/action from two different places, they overwrite each other and may lead to a loss of work. It's recommended that at any given time, only one user should edit a page in a single open tab. Appsmith supports [version control using Git](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git) which provides a way for multiple users to edit the apps on different branches before they can be merged into the master branch.
