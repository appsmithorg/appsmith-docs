# FAQ

## What kind of apps can be built on Appsmith?

You can use Appsmith to build custom forms, dashboards & workflows. Tools like Customer Support Dashboards, Offer Management Consoles & Product Cataloging Systems are all prime use cases for Appsmith. You can also use it as a clean UI layer over manually triggered scripts, confusing deployment pipelines & basic database CRUD operations. There's very little preventing you from using Appsmith to bring any idea to life but we've optimized the product to make building internal tools a hassle-free experience.

## Can I write code in Appsmith?

Yes, absolutely. You can write JS code anywhere inside the product within `{{ }}`. We know how complex and intricate business logic can be and trying to build it without code can get excruciating. Appsmith bridges mundane API and UI configurations with powerful code expressions to let you build the apps the way you see them fit.

## What type of data security does appsmith provide?

Appsmith safely encrypts all your database credentials and stores them securely. Appsmith also does not store any data returned from your data sources and acts only as a proxy layer to orchestrate the API / Query calls. Appsmith is an open-source platform and can be fully audited and deployed on-premise to ensure none of your data leaves your VPC.

## What if there is a missing feature that I need?

We take all community feature requests very seriously and the best way to request for a missing feature is by raising a [Github Issue](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/issues/new/choose). Alternatively, we welcome external contributions and would be happy to help you unblock yourself with a feature on the platform. This is our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/blob/release/contributions/CodeContributionsGuidelines.md).

## How do I get help building an app?

We provide support via our active discord community and GitHub issues. We're also happy to get on a call and help you build your apps! Read our [Getting Help Section](../#help-center)

## How is Appsmith different from other app builders?

Appsmith is the first **open-source** visual platform for building internal tools. Appsmith gives you building blocks (widgets, APIs, Queries) that you can configure and connect together using javascript. This ensures that you never get blocked trying to create a custom workflow and you don't spend time building repetitive components!

## What can't I do on Appsmith?

Appsmith isn't built for complicated UI interactions that are common to e-commerce or other consumer-facing websites. It works great for tools & workflows internal to your team or organization but you wouldn't get very far trying to build an attractive consumer website. For those use cases, we'd recommend you try [Wix](https://www.wix.com), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), or [Webflow](https://www.webflow.com).

## Does Appsmith support multi-user editing?

Appsmith currently is built for a single user editor experience. If you try to update the same page/widget/action from two different places, it will overwrite each other and will lead to a loss of work. We recommend that at a given time, only one user is editing a page in a single open tab. Multi-user editing is on our product roadmap for 2022.
