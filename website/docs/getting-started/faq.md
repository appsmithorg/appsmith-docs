# FAQs

## What types of applications are possible to create using Appsmith?

You can use Appsmith to build custom forms, dashboards & workflows. Tools like Customer Support Dashboards, Offer Management Consoles & Product Cataloging Systems are all prime use cases for Appsmith. You can also use it as a clean UI layer over manually triggered scripts, confusing deployment pipelines & basic database CRUD operations. There's very little preventing you from using Appsmith to bring any idea to life, but we've optimized the product to make building internal tools a hassle-free experience.

## What's the process for writing code in Appsmith?

Yes, absolutely. You can write JavaScript code anywhere inside the product within curly braces `{{ }}`, or using standard syntax within [JS Objects](/core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-editor-beta). We know how complex and intricate business logic can be, and trying to build it without code can get excruciating. Appsmith bridges mundane API and UI configurations with powerful code expressions to let you build the apps the way you see them fit.

For more information, see [writing code](/core-concepts/writing-code).

## What type of data security does Appsmith provide?

Appsmith safely encrypts all your database credentials and stores them securely. Appsmith doesn't store any data returned from your data sources and acts only as a proxy layer to orchestrate the API / Query calls. Appsmith is an open source platform and can be fully audited and deployed on-premise to ensure none of your data leaves your VPC.

## Do you have a bounty program for reporting security vulnerabilities?

No, we don't currently have a bounty program for reporting security vulnerabilities. However, we appreciate any information that can help us improve the security of our systems and protect our users' data. We do reward security researchers who report serious and previously undiscovered issues.

## How can a security vulnerability in Appsmith be reported?

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please email our security team at security@appsmith.com with a description of the issue and any relevant details. We will review your report and take appropriate action to address the issue.

## What options are available if a needed feature is missing from Appsmith?

We take all community feature requests very seriously, and the best way to request a missing feature is by raising a [Github Issue](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/issues/new/choose). Alternatively, we welcome external contributions and would be happy to help you unblock yourself with a feature on the platform. This is our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/blob/release/contributions/CodeContributionsGuidelines.md).

## How can assistance be obtained for app building using Appsmith?

We provide support via our active discord community and GitHub issues. We're also happy to get on a call and help you build your apps!

## How's Appsmith different from other app builders?

Appsmith is the first **open-source** visual platform for building internal tools. Appsmith gives you building blocks (widgets, APIs, Queries) that you can configure and connect using JavaScript. This ensures that you never get blocked trying to create a custom workflow, and don't spend time building repetitive components!

## What are the limitations of Appsmith?

Appsmith isn't built for complicated UI interactions that are common to e-commerce or other consumer-facing websites. It works great for tools and workflows internal to your team or organization, but you wouldn't get very far trying to build an attractive consumer website. For those use cases, we recommend you try [Wix](https://www.wix.com), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), or [Webflow](https://www.webflow.com).

## Does Appsmith support multi-user editing?

Appsmith is currently built for a single-user editor experience. If you try to update the same page/widget/action from two different places, they will overwrite each other and will lead to a loss of work. We recommend that at any given time, only one user should edit a page in a single open tab. Multi-user editing is on our roadmap for the future.


## Can you provide information on the countries where data processing takes place?
For cloud users, data processing takes place in the United States. However, if you are self-hosting Appsmith, we only collect your website usage data (which is anonymous) and intercom data.

## Is Appsmith HIPAA compliant?
If you need to ensure HIPAA compliance, you can choose to self-host Appsmith. This gives you complete control over how your data is stored, transmitted, and secured.
