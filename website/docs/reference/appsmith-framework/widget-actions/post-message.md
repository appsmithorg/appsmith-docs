# Post Message

The **Post message** action is used to enable safe cross-origin communication between [Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) objects; for example, between a page and a pop-up that it has created, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it. The Appsmith function `postWindowMessage` works by using the JavaScript function [`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) so that you can communicate between applications in situations such as:

- Appsmith being embedded in an iframe of a parent application.
- Appsmith using [Iframe](/reference/widgets/iframe/) widgets to embed other applications or pages.

## Signature

```javascript
postWindowMessage(message, targetIframe, targetOrigin)
```

### Arguments

| Argument Name | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| **message** | This is the message to send to the parent application. Most JavaScript values are acceptable here, except `null` and `undefined`. (Default: `""`) |
| **targetIframe** | This is the window to which you want to send the message. If its value is `"window"`, you are sending a message to the parent applicationâ€™s window (where Appsmith is embedded). If you want to send a message to an iframe within Appsmith, enter the name of the iframe here. (Default: `"window"`) |
| **targetOrigin** | This is the URL to which you can send messages. The default value of "`*`" means the message can be sent to any URL. If you want to limit sending messages to only the parent application (in which Appsmith is embedded), enter the URL of the parent application here. (Default: `"*"`) |

## Examples

### Page embedded in Appsmith

For these examples, imagine you are building an app in Appsmith that has an Iframe widget called `Iframe1` containing an embedded page.

##### From Appsmith to iframe

To send a piece of data (perhaps an email address) to that embedded page:

1. Drag and drop an [Input](/reference/widgets/input/) widget and a [Button](/reference/widgets/button) widget onto the canvas.
2. In the button's **onClick** event property, select **Post message**. Set the **Message** to `{{ Input1.text }}` and **Target iframe** to `Iframe1`.
3. On the canvas, enter your piece of data into the input widget, and click the button widget. The iframe has now received the message you sent.

:::note
If you want to try this but you need a page to receive your message, set up your iframe with this HTML string in its **srcDoc** property:

```html
<div id="target"></div>

<script>
    window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    const tgt = document.querySelector("#target")
        tgt.textContent = event.data
    });
</script>
```

When the iframe receives your message, it puts the message text into the `#target` div.

##### From iframe to Appsmith

To capture and handle a message that was sent to Appsmith from the page embedded in the iframe:

Use the iframe's [**onMessageReceived**](/reference/widgets/iframe#events) event in the properties pane. Choose an action or write code to be executed when the message is received from the embedded page. You can use the `Iframe1.message` property to access the content of the message that was received by Appsmith.

### Appsmith embedded in parent page

For these examples, imagine you are building a page outside of Appsmith, and you have embedded an Appsmith app into it using an [HTML iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

##### From Appsmith to parent page

To configure your Appsmith application to send messages to its parent page:

1. Drag and drop a [Button](/reference/widgets/button/) widget and an [Input](/reference/widgets/input/) widget onto the canvas.
2. In the button's properties, configure its **onClick** event to execute the **Post message** action. Set its **Message** field to `{{Input1.text}}`, and make sure that the **Target iframe** field is set to `window`.
3. On the canvas, enter some data in the input widget's field and click the button widget. Appsmith has just emitted a message to its parent window.

:::tip
The parent application where Appsmith is embedded should have an event listener set up to receive the message that you send from Appsmith. Read more about setting up message event handling [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/message_event).
