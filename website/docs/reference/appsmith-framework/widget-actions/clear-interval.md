## Signature

```javascript
clearInterval(id: string)
```

### Parameters

Below are the parameters required by the `clearInterval()` function to execute:


#### id

<dd>

The `id` is a string that represents the unique identifier of the interval timer you want to stop. This identifier must match the id specified when creating the interval with the `setInterval()` function. 

</dd>

## Usage

Here are a few examples of using `clearInterval()` in different situations:


#### Stop auto-refresh

<dd>

If you have a timer set up to automatically refresh data every few seconds and you want to stop it based on user interaction or a specific condition, you can use clearInterval().

```javascript
clearInterval("autorefresh");
```



</dd>
