# windowMessageListener()

:::info
This feature is available only in Appsmith's [business edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).
:::

`windowMessageListener()` is used to enable an Appsmith application to capture and react to the messages incoming from a parent application. This listener is page-scoped and is only active on the page where it's created.

## Signature

```javascript
windowMessageListener(domain: string, callback: function): Promise
```

### Parameters

#### domain

<dd>

A string that is the URL or domain of the website from which Appsmith expects to receive a message. The listener only listens for messages from the given domain when that domain is embedded in the Appsmith app; If the Appsmith app is embedded in some other website, the callback wonâ€™t be triggered.

If an active listener is already in place, it won't be overridden and a warning appears in the console. The use of the `"*"` wildcard is not allowed in this parameter, a specific web address is required.

</dd>

#### callback

<dd>

A callback function to be called whenever a message is received from the target domain. It accepts a parameter that is the incoming message.

</dd>

_Example:_

```javascript
windowMessageListener(
	"https://your-site.github.io", 
	(message) => { showAlert(message) }
)
```
