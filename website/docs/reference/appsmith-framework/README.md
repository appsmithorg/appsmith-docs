# Appsmith Framework

The Appsmith framework is designed to make it easy for developers to create dynamic, data-driven applications that respond to user interactions in real-time. It provides a range of utility functions and objects that allow developers to access important information, such as the current application URL or the authenticated user, and more. This makes it simple to build applications that are aware of the current context and can respond to changes in real-time.

One of the key features of the Appsmith framework is its in-built functions for storing values in the local storage. This allows developers to save and retrieve data that's specific to the current user or session, without having to worry about managing the storage themselves. This feature can be used to store information such as user preferences, session data, or temporary data that needs to be passed between pages. For more information, see [Actions](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions).

Additionally, Appsmith provides in-built global objects like the Query Object, Context object, and the Console Object that enables developers to run database queries and share data between different pages by passing parameters, and provides information about the current state of the application, respectively. For more information, see:
