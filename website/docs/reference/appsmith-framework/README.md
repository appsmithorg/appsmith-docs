# Appsmith Framework

The Appsmith framework provides utility functions and objects to get information, e.g., the application URL and the current user, to store values in the local storage, and to trigger actions, e.g., to show an alert message on a button click. The framework also provides a Query object to run queries and share data between pages by passing parameters.
