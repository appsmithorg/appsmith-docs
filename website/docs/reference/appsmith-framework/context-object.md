# appsmith

The `appsmith` object is a global object that provides access to information and functionalities within an application through objects and utility functions.

## Properties

The Appsmith object contains the following properties:

### store `object`

<dd>

This object lets you access any app-level data or temporary state that is stored on the user's browser. You can add or update data using the [storeValue()](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions/store-value) method. You can access saved data by referencing their keys:

```javascript
{{ appsmith.store.KEY_NAME }}
```

</dd>

### URL `object`

<dd>

This object contains all the attributes of the current URL that the user is on. To access these values from the URL, you can use the following code snippet:

```javascript
{{ appsmith.URL }}
```
URL object has the following attributes:

#### host `string`

<dd>

The host property of the URL is a string that consists of the hostname and the URL's port (if available). To access the host value, you can use the following code snippet:

```js
{{appsmith.URL.host}}
```
  
</dd>

#### hostname `string`

<dd>

The hostname property of the URL is a string that represents the URL's domain. In simpler terms, hostname is the [host](/reference/appsmith-framework/context-object#host) name (without the port number). To access the hostname, you can use the following code snippet:

```js
{{appsmith.URL.host}}
```

</dd>

#### fullPath `string`

<dd>

A full-path URL specifies the exact location of a resource, such as a page, app, file, or any other specific entity. A full-path URL includes the following components:

* Protocol
* Subdomain
* Domain Name
* Top Level Domain (TLD)
* Path
* Parameters

You can access the fullPath using the following snippet:

```js
{{appsmith.URL.fullPath}}
```

</dd>

#### pathname `string`

<dd>

The pathname is a string that represents the path component of the URL. It consists of a collection of path segments, with each segment prefixed by the `/` character. If the URL does not have any path segments, the value of the pathname property is an empty string. You can access the pathname using the following snippet:

```js
{{appsmith.URL.pathname}}
```

</dd>


#### port `string`

<dd>

The URL's port property is a string containing the URL's port number. You can access the port using the following snippet:

```js
{{appsmith.URL.port}}
```

</dd>

#### protocol `string`

<dd>

The protocol property of the URL is a string that represents the protocol scheme of the URL, including the `:`. The protocol identification and the resource name are separated by a colon and two forward slashes (`://`). To access the protocol value, use the following snippet:

```js
{{appsmith.URL.protocol}}
```

</dd>

#### hash `string`

<dd>

The value of the `appsmith.URL.hash` property is a string that represents the fragment identifier of the URL, including the `#` character. The fragment identifier is the portion of the URL that appears after the hashtag symbol (#), which is the hash property of the URL interface.

```js
{{appsmith.URL.hash}}
```

</dd>

#### queryParams `object`

<dd>

The query parameters are a component of a URL that allows for passing data to a web server or application. In a URL, query parameters are appended at the end of the URL with a `?` as a separator. You can access the value of `queryParams` using the following snippet:

```js
{{appsmith.URL.queryParams}}
```

The `queryParams` object can be used to [share data across pages](/advanced-concepts/sharing-data-across-pages#sharing-data-via-query-params).

#### idToken `object`

<dd>

An ID token serves as a verified confirmation of a user's identity and includes essential information such as their name, picture, email address etc. According to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifications, when a user successfully logs in, Appsmith receives an ID token.

Appsmith provides the `idToken` parameter on the client side, allowing you to incorporate it into various operations like JavaScript functions, APIs, or queries as needed. You can read the value of an ID token in your APIs/Queries by using the mustache syntax `{{}}` as shown below:

```js
{{appsmith.user.idToken}}
```
If you have defined custom scopes in your identity provider, the information associated with those scopes can be accessed within the Identity token.

</dd>
</dd>

### theme `object`

<dd>

</dd>
</dd>

### geolocation `object`

<dd>

This object contains functions that allow you to retrieve the current user's location and the coordinates received from the user's device using the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API).

```javascript
{
 canBeRequested: boolean,
 getCurrentPosition: Function,
 watchPosition: Function,
 clearWatch: Function,
 currentPosition: {
   coords: {
      accuracy: number,
      altitude: number | null,
      altitudeAccuracy: number | null,
      heading: number | null,
      latitude: number,
      longitude: number,
      speed: number | mull,
   },
   timestamp: number,
 }
}
```

#### geolocation.getCurrentPosition()

<dd>

Signature:

```javascript
(
 onSuccessCallback?,
 onErrorCallback?,
 options?: { maximumAge?: number, timeout?: number, enableHighAccuracy?: boolean } 
) -> void
```

Similar to the original browser API, the `getCurrentPosition` function retrieves the current user's location. However, unlike the original browser API, you don't need to pass a success callback function. On success, the location information is automatically stored at `appsmith.geolocation.currentPosition.coords`. If you provide an `onSuccessCallback` function, it is called with the received location information as a parameter.

</dd>

#### geolocation.watchPosition()

<dd>

Signature:

```javascript
(
  onSuccessCallback?,
  onErrorCallback?,
  options?: { maximumAge?: number, timeout?: number, enableHighAccuracy?: boolean } 
) -> void
```

Similar to the original browser API, the `getCurrentPosition` retrieves periodic updates about the current geographic location of the device, with the difference being that you don't need to pass a success callback explicitly. On success, the location is automatically stored at `appsmith.geolocation.currentPosition.coords` and `appsmith.geolocation.currentPosition.timestamp` is also updated to indicate the time of the last position update. If you provide callbacks, they are automatically executed when the location has changed. Unlike the browser API, no `watchId` is returned, as the platform only allows for a single `watchPosition` at a time.

</dd>

#### geolocation.clearWatch()

<dd>

Signature: `() -> Promise`

It is similar to the original browser API, with the difference being that you don't have to explicitly pass the `watchId`. Instead, if a watch is currently active, you must clear it before starting a new one.

</dd>
</dd>

### mode `enum`

<dd>

This field is an enum that contains whether the app runs in view or edit mode. It takes the values `VIEW` or `EDIT`.

</dd>
