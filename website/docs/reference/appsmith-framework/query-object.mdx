# Query Object

This page describes how to use the Query object to run queries and access the data from the response.

## run()

Calling a query's `run()` function executes that query. `run()` is asynchronous and returns a promise, so you can use it with async syntax like `.then()` chains and `async/await`. It can't be used in [synchronous fields](/core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#display-data-from-async-js-function).

### Signature

```
run(params: Object): Promise
```

| Argument      | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **params**    | An object containing key-value pairs to pass into the query. Accessed with `{{ this.params.key }}`. |


This function returns a JavaScript **promise**, which can be used to handle async actions in sequence. Use `.then()` and `.catch()` to write code to be executed when the query returns successfully or in error, respectively. Or, use `async/await` syntax.

```javascript
// Using promise syntax to chain actions in sequence
{{
    Query1.run(params)
        .then(() => {...}) // run after the query is successful
        .catch(() => {...}) // run if the query encounters any errors
}}
```

To learn more about chaining actions to create complex workflows, see [complex workflows](/core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#complex-workflows).

### Pass parameters to run() {#pass-parameters-to-run}

Most queries read values directly from entities as global variables. In some cases, like running a query inside a loop, parameters may need to be passed to the query with values contextual to the execution.

For this, use the `params` argument to pass an object of key-value pairs into your query. You can access these values within the query using `{{ this.params.key }}`.

#### Example

Imagine you need to fetch specific users from a database based on their `id` value. In this example, you'll see how to configure a query and a helper function to take an array of ids and run the query for each of them.

**Setup**

On the canvas, you should have a [Table widget](/reference/widgets/table) and a [Button widget](/reference/widgets/button).

Use Appsmith's mock Postgres `user` database to create a query called `GetUserById`. Add the following SQL statement to the query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {{ this.params.id }};
```

This statement expects a parameter to be passed in from the `run()` function to use as the `id` value.

Create a JS Object and name it `utils`. This is where you write your helper function that calls the query and handles its responses. The following code snippet runs the query once for each `id` in its `ids` array, waits for the database's response, and stores the resulting table records in the [Appsmith store](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions/store-value).

<Tabs queryString="current-run-style">
<TabItem label="Promise chains" value="promise-chains">

```javascript
// function in the utils JS Object
getByIds: async (ids) => {
    const queries = ids.map(id => {
        return GetUserById.run({"id": id})
    })
    
    Promise.allSettled(queries)
        .then(queryResponses => queryResponses.map(res => res.value[0]))
        .then(records => storeValue("records", records))
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="async/await" value="async-await">

```javascript
// function in the utils JS Object
getByIds: async (ids) => {
    const queries = ids.map(id => {
        return GetUserById.run({"id": id})
    })
    
    const responses = await Promise.allSettled(queries)
    const records = await responses.map(promise => promise.value[0])
    await storeValue("records", records)
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now when the `utils.getByIds()` function is run with an array of ids, you'll have your resulting records available in the Appsmith store. Bind this value to the **Table Data** property of your Table widget:

```javascript
// Table Data property of the Table widget
{{ appsmith.store.records }}
```

Finally, to execute the query, set the Button widget's **onClick** event to execute your helper function:

```javascript
// Button widget's onClick
{{ utils.getByIds([1, 4, 8, 34, 16])}}
```

When you click the button, it runs your helper function that queries the database for each of your desired users.

## Properties

These properties are used to reference and control data related to your query.

| Property         | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **data**         | Contains the response body from the last successful execution of this query. If this property is referenced in a widget's property field, the query is automatically run on page load. |
| **responseMeta** | Contains metadata from the last response to this query's execution.                          |
| **clear()**      | Empties all data from the query's **`data`** property.                                       |
| [**run()**](#signature) | Executes the query when called. Can't be called in sync fields; see [sync vs. async fields](/core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#display-data-from-async-js-function). |
