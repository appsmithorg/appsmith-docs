# query

The `query` object contains the parameters required to run queries and access the query data.


## Properties

The query object has the following properties that you can use to reference the query's response or check the status of the query.

### data `Array`

<dd>

`data` is a read-only property that contains the response body from the last successful execution of this query. 

```
{{Query1.data}}
```
If this property is referenced in a widget's property field, the query is automatically run on page load. You can manually enable a query to run on page load from the [query settings](/connect-data/reference/query-settings).

</dd>

### responseMeta `object`

<dd>

The `responseMeta` object contains details about the response, such as the status code, headers, and other relevant information related to the query's execution and the server's response.

```
{{Query1.responseMeta}}
```

</dd>


## Methods

Query object has the following methods that enable you to run a query or clear a query response.

### query.run()

<dd>

When you call the `run()` function of a query, it executes the query. 

#### Signature

```
run(params: Object): Promise
```

| Argument      | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **params**    | An object containing key-value pairs to pass into the query. You can access it using the key - `{{ this.params.KEY_NAME }}`. |


`run()` is an asynchronous function and it returns a promise. This asynchronous nature allows you to handle sequential asynchronous actions using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods or the `async/await` syntax. It can't be used in [synchronous fields](/core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#display-data-from-async-js-function).

```javascript
// Using promise syntax to chain actions in sequence
{{
    Query1.run(params)
        .then(() => {...}) // run after the query is successful
        .catch(() => {...}) // run if the query encounters any errors
}}
```

In certain scenarios, such as when running a query inside a loop, it may be necessary to pass parameters to the query with values that are contextual to the execution. For more information, see [Pass Parameters to Queries](/connect-data/how-to-guides/how-to-pass-params-to-an-api).

</dd>


### query.clear()

<dd>

This function clears all data from the query's `data` property.

``` 
{{Query1.clear()}}
```

</dd>
