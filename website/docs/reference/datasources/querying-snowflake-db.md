## Query Snowflake

The following section provides examples of creating basic CRUD queries for Snowflake.

### Fetch data

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer
OFFSET {{ CustomerTable.pageOffset }} ROWS
FETCH NEXT {{ CustomerTable.pageSize }} ROWS ONLY;
```

In the above example, `CustomerTable` is the name of the Table widget used to display the data using [**server-side pagination**](/reference/widgets/table#server-side-pagination) to control how much data is queried at once.

### Insert data

```sql
INSERT INTO customer
  (id, name, address, email)
VALUES
(
  DEFAULT,
  {{ NameInput.text }},
  {{ AddressInput.text }},
  {{ EmailInput.text }}
);
```

In the above example,Â `NameInput`, `AddressInput`, and `EmailInput` are the names of the widgets used to capture input from the user for name, address, and email fields, respectively.

### Update data

```sql
UPDATE customer
  SET email = {{ EmailInput.text }}
  WHERE id = {{ CustomerTable.selectedRow.id }};
```

In the above example, `EmailInput` is the name of the Input widget used to capture the email entered by the user. `CustomerTable` is the Table widget where the user selects the row to update the user's email.

### Delete data

```sql
DELETE FROM customer WHERE id = {{ CustomerTable.selectedRow.id }};
```

In the above example, `CustomerTable` is the name of the Table widget where the user selects the row for deletion.
