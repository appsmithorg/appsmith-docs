This page describes how to connect your application to your Oracle databases and use queries to manage its content.

:::tip
If you want to connect to a locally hosted database, you can use a service like ngrok to expose it. For more information, see [How to connect to local database on Appsmith](/advanced-concepts/more/how-to-work-with-local-apis-on-appsmith).
:::

To connect to your database, Appsmith needs the following parameters:

* **Host Address:** Provide the hostname or IP address of your database server. If you are connecting to a self-hosted database, see [this guide](/advanced-concepts/more/how-to-work-with-local-apis-on-appsmith).

* **Port:**  Provide the port on which to connect to your database.

* **Service Name:** Provide the service name for your database instance.

* **Authentication:** Provide the **Username** and **Password** for the user with which you are connecting to the database.

* **SSL Mode:** choose one of the following modes to set whether your queries use SSL to connect:
  * **TLS:** Appsmith attempts to connect using TLS.
  * **Disabled:** Appsmith won't attempt an SSL connection.

:::caution important
If you are a self-hosted user, you may need to whitelist the IP address of the Appsmith deployment on your database instance or VPC before connecting to a database.

18.223.74.85 and 3.131.104.27 are the IP addresses of the Appsmith cloud instances that need to be whitelisted.

## Select

Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve data from a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

It's highly recommended to include statements like `FETCH 10 ROWS ONLY` to prevent querying huge amounts of data at once. Use this along with `OFFSET` to paginate your data.

---

#### Example

> Fetch all records from a table `users`, 10 records at a time, and put them into a Table widget `UsersTable`.

* Create a query called `FetchUsers` based on your Oracle datasource, and a [Table widget](/reference/widgets/table) on the canvas called `UsersTable`.

* This query is a `SELECT` operation, and uses properties from the Table widget along with to calculate which subset of the table to return for each page.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users
  ORDER BY employee_id
  OFFSET {{ UsersTable.pageOffset }} ROWS
  FETCH {{ UsersTable.pageSize }} ROWS ONLY;
  ```

* In your Table widget, turn on **Server side pagination**. In the **onPageChange** event, select the **Execute a query > FetchUsers** action. Now when the page buttons in the table header are clicked, the query fetches the correct page of data.

* In the **Table Data** property of your Table widget, bind the result of your query:

  ```javascript
  // in the Table Data property of UsersTable
  {{ FetchUsers.data }}
  ```

Your table should fill with data when the query is run.

## Insert

Use `INSERT` statements to add new records to your database tables. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO users
  (name, date_of_birth, employee_id)
VALUES
  ('Alan Lee', '1989/11/2', 1009 );
```

---

#### Example

> Create a new record in a table `users`, with columns for `name`, `date_of_birth`, and `employee_id`.

* Create your query called `InsertNewUser` based on your Oracle datasource.

* To gather data, create a [JSON Form](/reference/widgets/json-form) on the canvas called `NewUserForm`. Add **Source Data** to the JSON Form to create input fields:

  ```json
  {{
    {
      name: "",
      date_of_birth: "",
      employee_id: ""
    }
  }}
  ```

* In JSON Form's Submit [button](/reference/widgets/button) properties, configure the **onClick** event to execute your query:

  ```javascript
  // Submit button's onClick event
  {{ InsertNewUser.run() }}
  ```

* Once these form fields are filled out, you can add their values to your query's SQL statement as below:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users
    (name, date_of_birth, employee_id)
  VALUES
    (
      {{ NewUserForm.formData.name }},
      {{ NewUserForm.formData.date_of_birth }},
      {{ NewUserForm.formData.employee_id }}
    );

  ```

When the Submit button is clicked, your query is executed and the new record is inserted into your table.

## Update

Use `UPDATE` statements to change the values of existing records in your database:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET name = 'Allen Lee'
WHERE employee_id = 1009;
```

---

#### Example

> Modify a record in a table `users`, with columns for `name`, `date_of_birth`, and `employee_id`.

* Create your query called `UpdateUser` based on your Oracle datasource. You should have a [Table widget](/reference/widgets/table) `UsersTable` containing your users data from another `SELECT` query.

* Create a [JSON Form widget](/reference/widgets/json-form) to use for submitting your updated values. Add **Source Data** to the JSON Form to create input fields. Reference the `selectedRow` of `UsersTable` to pre-fill the form fields:

  ```json
  {{
    {
      name: UsersTable.selectedRow.name,
      date_of_birth: UsersTable.selectedRow.date_of_birth
    }
  }}
  ```

  You may want to remove any field that's used as a unique identifier for your record; in this case, `employee_id` isn't in the form because it's unique to each user and is used to identify them in the dataset.

* In JSON Form's Submit [button](/reference/widgets/button) properties, configure the **onClick** event to execute your query:

  ```javascript
  // Submit button's onClick event
  {{ UpdateUser.run() }}
  ```

* To add your modified row data to your query, reference them in your SQL statement:

  ```sql
  UPDATE users
  SET
    name = {{ UpdateUserForm.formData.name }},
    date_of_birth = {{ UpdateUserForm.formData.date_of_birth }}
  WHERE employee_id = {{ UsersTable.selectedRow.employee_id }};
  ```

When the Submit button is clicked, your query is executed and the record is updated in your table.

## Delete

Use `DELETE` statements to delete records from your table:

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE employee_id = 1009;
```

---

#### Example

> Delete a record from a table `users`.

* Create your query called `DeleteUser` based on your Oracle datasource. You should have a [Table widget](/reference/widgets/table) `UsersTable` containing your table data from a `SELECT` query.

* Create a [Button widget](/reference/widgets/button) on the canvas and update its **Label** to "Delete." Set its **onClick** event to execute your `DeleteUser` query:

  ```javascript
  // in the Delete button's onClick event
  {{ DeleteUser.run() }}
  ```

* To delete a specific record, you should reference it with a uniquely identifying value, such as its `employee_id` in this case. In your `DeleteUser` query, bind the `employee_id` value of the Table's selected row:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM users
  WHERE employee_id = {{ UsersTable.selectedRow.employee_id }};
  ```

Now when the button is clicked, the query is run and the corresponding row is deleted from your table.
