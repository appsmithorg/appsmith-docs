### **Connection**

You need to fill in the following parameters:

* **Connection Mode\*:** You must choose one of the following two modes:
  * **Read Only:** Choosing this mode gives Appsmith read-only permission on the database. This allows you to only fetch data from the database.
  * **Read / Write:** Choosing this mode gives Appsmith both read and write permissions on the database. This allows you to execute all CRUD queries.
* **Host Address / Port\*:** Fill in the database host’s address and port. If you don’t specify a port, Appsmith connects to port 5439.
* **Database Name\*:** Fill in the name of the database that you want to connect to. This is your database’s name.

### **Authentication**

You need to fill in the following parameters:

* **Username\*:** Fill username required for authenticating connection requests to your database.
* **Password\*:** Fill password required for authenticating connection requests for the given username to the database.

* **SSL Mode:** Choose your SSL model from the dropdown.
* **Key File:** Upload your SSL key file from here.
* **Certificate:** Upload your SSL certificate here.
* **CA Certificate:** Upload your CA certificate here.

## Querying Redshift

Redshift databases can be queried using the standard [SQL syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cm\_chap\_SQLCommandRef.html). All Redshift queries return an array of objects where each object is a row returned by the query and each property in the object is a column. Appsmith provides template queries to help with the syntax
