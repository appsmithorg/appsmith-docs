# HubSpot


HubSpot is a **cloud-based CRM** designed to help align sales and marketing teams, promote sales, increase ROI, and improve your inbound marketing strategy to produce more qualified leads. In simple words, it's a software platform created to assist your business with marketing and sales.

:::info
To integrate HubSpot with Appsmith, you should understand the basics of [connecting to datasource](/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/) on Appsmith.
:::

Appsmith provides an easy way to integrate with HubSpot, and enables you to perform different operations using a custom UI built with minimal configurations.


# Create HubSpot Datasource

To add a HubSpot API, navigate to **Explorer** >> Click the **+** icon (next to Datasources) >> Select **HubSpot** under APIs.

## Connection settings

Configure the HubSpot API as illustrated below:

### Authentication Type
Appsmith allows you to select from the available authentication types to integrate with an HubSpot database:

#### Bearer Token 

Bearer Tokens are the predominant access token used with [OAuth 2.0](/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/authentication-type/oauth2-authentication/).
You can authenticate to the API by providing your access token in the HTTP authorization bearer token header.

Let's see how you can fetch your Bearer Token:

* Open [**HubSpot**](https://www.hubspot.com/products).
* You can **create a new account** or select an existing one.
* Click the **settings** icon on top-right corner, and select integrations.
* Create a private app (or open an existing one).
* Navigate to **Scopes**.
* Allow necessary permissions for **CMS, CRM, and Settings**.
* Navigate to the auth page of your app settings.
* Here you'll be able to find the app's **client ID** and [**access token**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/oauth/tokens).


Access token looks something like this:

```
pat-na1-217ee**-****-****-****-***
```


## Create queries

You can add queries to the newly created HubSpot datasource in one of the below ways:


### Datasource page
You can add queries to HubSpot datasource by selecting the **New API +** button available on the datasource page.

## Using queries in applications

Once you have successfully run a Query, you can use it in your app to:

* [Display Data ](/core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/displaying-data-read/)
* [Capture Data ](/core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/capturing-data-write/capture-form-data.md)
* [Execute Queries](/core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/)
