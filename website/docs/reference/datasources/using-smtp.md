</figure>

To add an SMTP datasource:

1. Click the (**+**) sign in the **Explorer** tab next to **Datasources**.
1. On the next screen, select the **SMTP** button. This creates the datasource and takes you to the datasource's configuration page.
1. Enter the URL for your SMTP server into the **Host Address** field.
1. Enter the port for your SMTP server into the **Port** field.
1. Enter your account's username in the **Username** field. Depending on your SMTP provider, this might be your email address.
1. Enter your password into the **Password** field.

:::note
Some SMTP providers use a multi-factor authentication flow and may require you to generate a special password specifically to authenticate your Appsmith app. For example, Gmail SMTP requires you to [generate an app password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) to use instead of your usual password.

7. Once you've entered your credentials, click the **Test** button to check that they are working.
8. Click **Save** when you are finished, and your datasource is ready for queries.

## Create queries

You can write queries to send emails through your SMTP server by selecting the **+ New Query**  button on the SMTP datasource page, or by clicking (**+**) next to **Queries/JS** in the **Explorer** tab and selecting your SMTP datasource. You'll be brought to a new query screen where you can write a query.

You can write [queries](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/query-settings) to send emails through your SMTP server by selecting the **+ New Query**  button on the SMTP datasource page, or by clicking (**+**) next to **Queries/JS** in the **Explorer** tab and selecting your SMTP datasource. You'll be brought to a new query screen where you can write a query.


## Send email

This action sends an email through your SMTP server.

When the query is successful, you'll recieve the following response:
```json
{
  "message": "Sent the email successfully"
}
```

#### Example

> Use a Form widget to write and send an email.

**Setup**:

Create an SMTP datasource and a query `SendMail` based on it.

**Configure the email form**:

1. Create a [Form widget](/reference/widgets/form) `EmailForm`, and update the title to `Send Mail`.
1. In the form's body area, create widgets to accept input for the email's configuration fields such as **To email(s)**, **From email(s)**, **Subject**, etc.
    1. Use [Rich Text Editor widget](/reference/widgets/rich-text-editor) for the **Body** field, and a [Filepicker widget](/reference/widgets/filepicker) for the **Attachment(s)** field.
    1. Be sure to name each widget so that you can reference it later in your query.
1. In the properties for the form's submit button, configure the **onClick** action to execute your `SendMail` query.

**Configure the query**:

1. In each configuration field, reference the appropriate widget from the Form that contains its intended value. For example, you can use the Form's `data` property, followed by the input widget's name and the property that holds its content:
  ```javascript
  // in the "From email" field
  {{ EmailForm.data.FromInput.text }}
  ```
  ```javascript
  // in the "Body" field
  {{ EmailForm.data.BodyEditor.text }}
  ```
  ```javascript
  // in the "Attachment(s)" field
  {{ EmailForm.data.AttachmentPicker.files }}
  ```

Once you fill in your form fields, your query is ready to send the email.
