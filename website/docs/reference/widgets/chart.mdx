# Chart

This document explains how to effectively use the Chart widget to visualize and represent data to create admin panels, dashboards, and other data-driven applications.



<VideoEmbed host="youtube" videoId="MadSMf9SOaE" title="How to use Chart Widget" caption="Configure Chart Widget"/>


## Display data

To display data in the Chart widget, you can use the **Series Data** property to provide the data in the following structure: 

```js
[
  {
    "x": "Product1",
    "y": 20000
  },..
]
```

In this format, **`x`** denotes the **label** and **`y`** denotes the **value**. It's important to provide a value when displaying data to ensure the chart can render correctly. 

Appsmith offers several built-in charts to represent your data. With the **Chart Type** property, you can select one of the following types to visualize your data:
* Line Charts, 
* Bar Charts, 
* Pie Charts, 
* Column Charts, 
* Area Charts, and  
* [Custom Charts](#custom-charts)


To display static data, you can enter the desired data directly into the **Series Data property**, and it remains the same until manually updated or edited. This method is useful when you need to display fixed information, such as trends or comparisons, that don't change based on user interactions. 


### Display data dynamically

You can display dynamic data from queries or JS functions by binding the response to the **Series Data** property. 

For example, lets say you have a PostgreSQL database containing information about assets in your organization, such as their types and the date they were purchased. You can create a query that groups the assets by type and counts how many there are of each type, like this:

```sql
select type as x, count (*) as y from asset group by type
```

This query returns data in the required format, where `x` represents the asset type and `y` represents the count of assets of that type. Next, in the chart widget's **Series Data** property, add `{{assetquery.data}}` to bind the data returned by the query to the chart. This displays a dynamic chart that updates as the data in the database changes.

#### Transform data using JS
In addition, you can use JavaScript code to transform the incoming data to match the expected structure. This can be useful in cases where the data needs to be processed or manipulated before being displayed in the chart.

For example, suppose you have business revenue data stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet and you want to display it in a chart. To do this, you can connect to the Google Sheets datasource and create a query to fetch the data. Once you have retrieved the data, you may need to transform it using the following syntax:

```js
{{Api1.data.map( p => ({x: p.year, y: p.amount}))}}
```

The code preceding uses the `map()` function to transform each item in the `Api1.data` array into an object with an `x` and a `y` property. 

In this example, the `x` property represents the **year** and the `y` property represents the **amount** of data for that year. The transformed data displays a dynamic chart that updates as the data in the Google Sheets spreadsheet changes.


### Display multiple data series

If you want to display multiple data series on a chart, you can do so by using the **Add Series** property. This feature allows you to populate the chart with different sets of data and customize various aspects of its appearance, such as colors and labels, to create a visually appealing and informative chart.

For example, if you have data on the number of males and females who voted in each year of a political election, you can use the **Chart Series** property to display both sets of data on the same chart. This would allow you to compare the number of male and female voters over time.

## Custom charts

Appsmith offers integration with [FusionCharts](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/list-of-charts/) and provides a wide range of chart types that can be used to create custom charts. Once you have selected the **Chart Type > Custom Chart**, you can configure FusionCharts using the **Custom Fusion Chart** property.

:::


In the **Custom Fusion Chart** property, you need to specify **"type"** for chart type and **"dataSource"** for the data to create a custom FusionChart.



#### Type

The type is used to define the chart type recognized by the FusionCharts. FusionCharts provides an extensive range of chart variants, with almost 100+ options to choose from. To learn more about these charts, you can refer to the official [FusionCharts documentation](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/list-of-charts/). 

#### Datasource

The datasource defines the customization options and the data points to create a chart. It includes two attributes: **chart** and **data**.

The chart object can customize the chart and includes options like caption, xAxisName, and yAxisName. On the other hand, the data attribute represents the data in an array format with key-value pairs like `[{“label”: “string value”, “value”: “string value”}]`.

Below is an example of a configuration for the Custom Fusion Chart property:

```
{
  "type": "",
  "dataSource": {
    "chart": {},
    "data": []
  }
}
```

### Examples
Here are some examples of custom charts that you can use as a reference to create your own customized charts.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="2D" label="2D column chart " default>

Suppose you want to create a custom FusionChart to display monthly revenue data for Harry's SuperMart. You can use a two-dimensional column chart for this purpose.

You can either embed the configuration directly or use a query to retrieve the required configuration. To plot a column chart in a 2-dimensional, you can use the configuration as below:

```json
{
  "type": "column2d",
  "dataSource": {
    "chart": {
      "caption": "Monthly Revenue for the year 2021",
      "xAxisName": "Month",
      "yAxisName": "Revenue",
      "theme": "fusion"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "label": "Jan",
        "value": 42000
      },
      {
        "label": "Feb",
        "value": 810000
      },
      {
        "label": "Mar",
        "value": 72000
      },
      {
        "label": "Apr",
        "value": 55000
      },
      {
        "label": "May",
        "value": 91000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In the preceding code snippet, you’ll see that you plotted a column chart to showcase the monthly revenue pattern for last year, say - 2021.

 If you have several sister companies operating under the same business name and you want to display the monthly revenue chart specifically for Harry's SuperMart, you can use the `subCaption` property to specify the name of the company.

```
 “subCaption”: "Harry's SuperMart"
```


To format the revenue values on the chart, you can choose a series (`y-axis`) to show `$` as a prefix. You can use `numberPrefix` and add the dollar($) sign.

```
 “numberPrefix": "$"
```



You have a monthly target revenue of say $70,000 and would want to plot it in the chart. You can use `trendlines` to add this detail to your chart.

```
"trendlines": [
    {
      "line": [
        {
          "startValue": "700000",
          "valueOnRight": "1",
          "displayvalue": "Monthly Target"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```


`trendlines` are vertical or horizontal lines that help users understand the emphasized data point. For example, a monthly target.




  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="p3" label=" Pareto 3D chart" default>
  

Pareto chart is a type of bar graph that display the frequency of change with bars following a pattern from longest on the left to shortest on the right. To visualize data, a Pareto 3D chart can be used which combines a line chart and a column chart.


<figure>
  <img src="/img/pareto-3d.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Admin Settings option is available in the left sidebar"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


To display a Pareto 3D chart for "Harry's SuperMart" example, modify the type value in the configuration to `pareto3d`:

```json
{
  "type": "pareto3d",
  "dataSource": {
     "chart": {
      "caption": "Monthly Revenue for the year 2021",
      "xAxisName": "Month",
      "yAxisName": "Revenue",
      "theme": "fusion"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "label": "Jan",
        "value": 42000
      },
      {
        "label": "Feb",
        "value": 810000
      },
      {
        "label": "Mar",
        "value": 72000
      },
      {
        "label": "Apr",
        "value": 55000
      },
      {
        "label": "May",
        "value": 91000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can add the below code snippet to have a customized tooltip.

```
"plottooltext": "$label accounted for &lt;b>$datavalue&lt;/b> revenue"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="p4" label="Pie 3D chart">


Pie chart is a type of data visualization that represents numerical data in a circular graph, where the size of each "slice" of the pie corresponds to the proportion of data it represents.

  <img src="/img/pie3d.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Admin Settings option is available in the left sidebar"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


To display a Pie 3D chart for "Harry's SuperMart" example, modify the type value in the configuration to `pie3d`:


```
{
  "type": "pie3d",
  "dataSource": {
     "chart": {
      "caption": "Monthly Revenue for the year 2021",
      "xAxisName": "Month",
      "yAxisName": "Revenue",
      "theme": "fusion"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "label": "Jan",
        "value": 42000
      },
      {
        "label": "Feb",
        "value": 810000
      },
      {
        "label": "Mar",
        "value": 72000
      },
      {
        "label": "Apr",
        "value": 55000
      },
      {
        "label": "May",
        "value": 91000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For a sliced view, you can use a property `enablemultislicing`:

```
"enablemultislicing": "1"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="s3d" label="Stacked Column 3D Chart">

A stacked column chart is a type of data visualization that allows for the comparison of parts of a whole over time or across different sets of data.
