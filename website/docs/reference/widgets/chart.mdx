# Chart

This document explains how to use the Chart widget effectively to visualize and represent data to create admin panels, dashboards, and other data-driven applications. 

Appsmith offers several built-in charts to represent your data. With the **Chart Type** property, you can select one of the following types to visualize your data:
* Line Chart, 
* Bar Chart, 
* Pie Chart, 
* Column Chart, 
* Area Chart, and  
* [Custom Chart](#custom-charts)

## Display data

To display data in the Chart widget, you can use the **Series Data** property to provide the data in the following structure: 

```js
[
  {
    "x": "Product1",
    "y": 20000
  },..
]
```

In this format, **`x`** denotes the **label**, and **`y`** denotes the **value**. 

You can display dynamic data from queries or JS functions by binding the response to the **Series Data** property. 

### Transform the data

If the data is not in the desired format, you can use JavaScript to transform the data by adding it to the **Series Data** property.


```js
{{fetchUserData.data.map( p => ({x: p.gender, y: p.count}))}}
```
The code uses the `map()` function to transform each item in the `fetchUserData.data` array into an object with an `x` and a `y` key.


:::note
If the query fails and there is no default data specified, the chart doesn't render and appears empty.
:::




### Plot multiple data series

If you want to display multiple data series on a chart, you can do so by using the **Add Series** property. This feature allows you to populate the chart with different sets of data and customize various aspects of its appearance, such as colors and labels, to create a visually appealing and informative chart.

For example, suppose you have data on the number of males and females who voted each year, you can use the **Chart Series** property to display both data sets on the same chart. This would allow you to compare the number of male and female voters over time.

The following section demonstrates the different types of built-in charts for data visualization: 

<Tabs queryString="current-chart-type">
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Line Chart" default>

A line chart displays data as a series of points connected by a line. It's a useful tool for representing data that changes over time, such as stock prices or temperature fluctuations. 
 
By adding multiple series, you can compare the relationships between different sets of data over time, just like in the political election example.  

  <figure>
  <img src="/img/line-voter.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt=""/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
  </figure>


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Bar Chart">


  A bar chart displays data as a series of rectangular bars of varying lengths, with each bar representing a category or group.
  
  It's commonly used to compare different data points, such as sales figures for different products. By adding multiple series, you can compare and contrast data across different categories.

  <figure>
  <img src="/img/bar-voter.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt=""/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
  </figure>  
    
  </TabItem>
  
    <TabItem value="1banana" label="Column Chart">

  A column chart is similar to a bar chart, but the bars are arranged vertically instead of horizontally. 
    
  It's often used to display data in a more compact format or to make comparisons between groups of data. Adding multiple series can help you visualize relationships and differences between data across different categories.
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/new-col-chart.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt=""/>
    <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
   </figure>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="b2anana" label="Area Chart">

  An area chart is a type of line chart where the space between the line and the x-axis is filled with color, creating an area. 
    
  It's often used to display trends over time, such as changes in revenue or population. Multiple series can be added to compare the relationship between different sets of data over time, similar to the example with the political election data.
     
  <figure>
   <img src="/img/new-area-chart.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt=""/>
     <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
  </figure>
  

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="banana" label="Pie Chart">

  A pie chart displays data as a circular graph, with each slice representing a portion of the whole. It's commonly used to show the proportion of each category in a set of data. Only a single series of data can be used to plot a pie chart.

## Custom charts

Appsmith offers integration with [FusionCharts](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/list-of-charts/) and provides a wide range of chart types that can be used to create custom charts. Once you have selected the **Chart Type > Custom Chart**, you can configure FusionCharts using the **Custom Fusion Chart** property.

### Display data in custom chart
In the **Custom Fusion Chart** property, you need to specify "type" for chart type and "dataSource" for the data to create a custom FusionChart. Below is an example of a configuration for the Custom Fusion Chart property:

```json
{
  "type": "",
  "dataSource": {
    "chart": {},
    "data": []
  }
}
```

* **Type :** The type is used to define the chart type recognized by the FusionCharts. FusionCharts provides an extensive range of chart variants, with almost 100+ options to choose from. 

   ```json
    //example 
    "type": "column2d"
   ```
This creates a 2D column chart. The value of the `type` property is case-sensitive.

* **Datasource :** The datasource defines the customization options and data points necessary for creating a chart. It consists of attributes such as chart and data, which may vary depending on the chart type.
  
    ```json
  //example
    {
    "chart": {
        "caption": "Monthly revenue for last year",
        "xAxisName": "Month",
        "yAxisName": "Revenues (In USD)",
        "theme": "fusion"
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "label": "Jan",
            "value": "420000"
        },
      ```

You can refer to the official [FusionCharts documentation](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/list-of-charts/) documentation to learn more about these charts.


#### Examples
Here are some examples of custom charts that you can use as a reference to create your own customized charts.


<Tabs queryString="current-custom-chart">
  <TabItem value="2D" label="2D column " default>

Suppose you want to create a custom FusionChart to display monthly revenue data for Harry's SuperMart. You can use a two-dimensional column chart for this purpose.

You can either embed the configuration directly or use a query to retrieve the required configuration. To plot a column chart in a 2-dimensional, you can use the configuration as below:

```json
{
  "type": "column2d",
  "dataSource": {
    "chart": {
      "caption": "Monthly Revenue for the year 2021",
      "xAxisName": "Month",
      "yAxisName": "Revenue",
      "theme": "fusion"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "label": "Jan",
        "value": 42000
      },
      {
        "label": "Feb",
        "value": 810000
      },
      {
        "label": "Mar",
        "value": 72000
      },
      {
        "label": "Apr",
        "value": 55000
      },
      {
        "label": "May",
        "value": 91000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In the preceding code snippet, you’ll see that you plotted a column chart to showcase the monthly revenue pattern for last year, say - 2021.

 If you have several sister companies operating under the same business name and you want to display the monthly revenue chart specifically for Harry's SuperMart, you can use the `subCaption` property to specify the name of the company.

```
 “subCaption”: "Harry's SuperMart"
```


To format the revenue values on the chart, you can choose a series (`y-axis`) to show `$` as a prefix. You can use `numberPrefix` and add the dollar($) sign.

```
 “numberPrefix": "$"
```



You have a monthly target revenue of say $70,000 and would want to plot it in the chart. You can use `trendlines` to add this detail to your chart.

```
"trendlines": [
    {
      "line": [
        {
          "startValue": "700000",
          "valueOnRight": "1",
          "displayvalue": "Monthly Target"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```


`trendlines` are vertical or horizontal lines that help users understand the emphasized data point. For example, a monthly target.




  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="p3" label=" Pareto 3D" default>
  

Pareto chart is a type of bar graph that display the frequency of change with bars following a pattern from longest on the left to shortest on the right. To visualize data, a Pareto 3D chart can be used which combines a line chart and a column chart.


<figure>
  <img src="/img/pareto-3d.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Admin Settings option is available in the left sidebar"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


To display a Pareto 3D chart for "Harry's SuperMart" example, modify the type value in the configuration to `pareto3d`:

```json
{
  "type": "pareto3d",
  "dataSource": {
     "chart": {
      "caption": "Monthly Revenue for the year 2021",
      "xAxisName": "Month",
      "yAxisName": "Revenue",
      "theme": "fusion"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "label": "Jan",
        "value": 42000
      },
      {
        "label": "Feb",
        "value": 810000
      },
      {
        "label": "Mar",
        "value": 72000
      },
      {
        "label": "Apr",
        "value": 55000
      },
      {
        "label": "May",
        "value": 91000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can add the below code snippet to have a customized tooltip.

```
"plottooltext": "$label accounted for &lt;b>$datavalue&lt;/b> revenue"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="p4" label="Pie 3D">


Pie chart is a type of data visualization that represents numerical data in a circular graph, where the size of each "slice" of the pie corresponds to the proportion of data it represents.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/pie3d.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Admin Settings option is available in the left sidebar"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


To display a Pie 3D chart for "Harry's SuperMart" example, modify the type value in the configuration to `pie3d`:


```
{
  "type": "pie3d",
  "dataSource": {
     "chart": {
      "caption": "Monthly Revenue for the year 2021",
      "xAxisName": "Month",
      "yAxisName": "Revenue",
      "theme": "fusion"
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "label": "Jan",
        "value": 42000
      },
      {
        "label": "Feb",
        "value": 810000
      },
      {
        "label": "Mar",
        "value": 72000
      },
      {
        "label": "Apr",
        "value": 55000
      },
      {
        "label": "May",
        "value": 91000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For a sliced view, you can use a property `enablemultislicing`:

```
"enablemultislicing": "1"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="s3d" label="Stacked Column 3D">

A stacked column chart is a type of data visualization that allows for the comparison of parts of a whole over time or across different sets of data.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/3d-chart.png" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Admin Settings option is available in the left sidebar"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i></i></figcaption>
