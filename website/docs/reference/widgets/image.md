# Image

The Image widget is a fundamental component in displaying images within your application. It enables you to incorporate visual elements by accepting images in the form of URLs or valid base64 strings. 

Appsmith supports a wide range of popular image formats such as JPG, PNG, SVG, WebP, and even GIFs, providing you with flexibility in selecting the format that best suits your application needs.

## Display static image 

To display an image, you can specify the image source using the **Image property**. The Image property can accept a **URL**, a **data URI**, or a **base64** encoded image data as its input. For example, you can add this URL in the image property:

```js
https://jpeg.org/images/jpegsystems-home.jpg
```

Moreover, you can also set a **default image** to be displayed in case the image source fails to load or is invalid. This can be accomplished by specifying the default image as an image URL, data URI, or a base64 encoded image data in the Default Image property. 

### Inline SVG

Inline SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics, refers to an XML-based markup language used to display vector images on the web. To display inline SVG, paste the URL with your SVG code in the image property:

```js
data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,{{encodeURI('<svg..<your-svg>.. ></svg>')}}

//example
data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='100' height='100'%3E%3Ccircle cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='green' stroke-width='4' fill='yellow' /%3E%3C/svg%3E
```


## Display image dynamically
You can dynamically generate images by fetching data from an API or querying a data source. This allows you to display images that change based on user input or external data sources.


### By table row selection
You can dynamically populate an image based on another widget. For example, you have a Table displaying a list of users with their respective image URLs stored in a column.

![By table row selection ](</img/imagetable.gif>)

 To do this, use the ```{{Table1.selectedRow.image}}``` in the image property where "Table1" is the name of your table widget and "image" is the name of the column containing the image URL.



## Read image

To access the image data, simply reference the binding property in your code or queries using the following syntax:

```js
{{widget_name.image}}
```

This displays the image corresponding to the URL/Base64 specified in the Image property.

You can also use the ```{{widget_name.image}}``` in your queries or JavaScript code to access and manipulate the image data. For instance, you can use this property to pass the image data to an API or to perform image processing operations.

## Download image
You can add a trigger that runs any API or perform an action when the image is clicked. To do this, you can also toggle the "**Download Image**" property in the image widget's property pane. Once enabled, a download icon would appear on the image widget. Clicking on the download icon triggers the download of the image.


![Download image](</img/download-image-widget.gif>)

In addition you can also write the JavaScript query to run the desired action when the image is clicked. For example, to download an image, you can set the onClick event to:

```js
{{download(Image3.image,'my-image-name','image/png')}}
```
## Properties
Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.

### Widget properties
These properties are present in the property pane of the widget. The following table lists all the widget properties.
