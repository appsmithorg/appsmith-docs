# Image

You can add images in the form of URLs or base64 strings. The Image widget supports popular formats such as JPG, PNG, SVG, WebP and GIF.

## Display static image 

To display an image, you can specify the image source using the **Image property**. The Image property can accept a **URL**, a **data URI**, or a **base64** encoded image data as its input. For example, you can add this URL in the image property:

```js
https://jpeg.org/images/jpegsystems-home.jpg
```

You can also set an image in the **default image** property to be displayed if the image source fails to load or is invalid. This can be accomplished by specifying the default image as an image URL, data URI, or a base64 encoded image data in the Default Image property. 


 

### Inline SVG

To display inline SVG, paste your SVG content in the Image property in the format shown below:

```js
data:image/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,{{encodeURI('<svg..<your-svg>.. ></svg>')}}

//example
data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='100' height='100'%3E%3Ccircle cx='50' cy='50' r='40' stroke='green' stroke-width='4' fill='yellow' /%3E%3C/svg%3E
```


## Display image dynamically
Fetching data from an API or querying a data source. This allows you to display images that change based on user input or other components such as widget or query.


### By table row selection
You can dynamically populate an image based on another widget. For example, you have a Table displaying a list of users with their respective image URLs stored in a column.

![By table row selection ](</img/imagetable.gif>)

 To do this, use the ```{{Table1.selectedRow.image}}``` in the image property where "Table1" is the name of your table widget and "image" is the name of the column containing the image URL.



## Read image

To read the data in an Image widget, use the `image` reference property in your JS code or queries as shown below

```js
{{Image1.image}}
```

This displays the image corresponding to the URL/Base64 specified in the Image property.


### Fetch image from S3

To fetch an image from [S3](/reference/datasources/querying-amazon-s3), follow these steps:

* Click the plus icon next to queries/js and choose your S3 datasource.
* Select the "Read file" method from the Commands drop-down menu.
* Provide the required parameters for reading the file, including the bucket name, file path, and file data type.

Once you have added all the required parameters, in the Image property pane, add:
```js
{{<your_query_name>.data.fileData}}
```


## Download image
You can toggle the "**Enable Download**" property in the image widget's property pane. Once enabled, a download icon would appear on the image widget. Clicking on the download icon triggers the download of the image.


![Download image](</img/download-image-ss.png>)

In addition you can also write the JavaScript code to run the desired [actions](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions) when the image is clicked. For example, to download an image, you can set the onClick event to:

```js
{{download(Image3.image,'my-image-name','image/png')}}
```
