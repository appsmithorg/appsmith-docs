# Multiselect

This document explains how to use a multi-select widget to allow users to select multiple options from a predetermined list.

## Display options manually

To manually display options in a Multiselect widget, you can use the **Options** property. The Options property is used to specify the available options for the user to choose from. It allows you to set both the label and value for each item in the dropdown list. 

The options must be specified as an array of objects, where each object has two properties: `label` and `value`. The `label` property represents the text that's displayed to the user, while the `value` property is the actual data that's stored and used in your application. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Blue",
    "value": "BLUE"
  },
  {
    "label": "Green",
    "value": "GREEN"
  },
  {
    "label": "Red",
    "value": "RED"
  }
]
```

## Display options dynamically 

Instead of creating a predetermined set of options, you can dynamically generate options by fetching data from an API or querying a data source.


---
**Example:** suppose you want to get a list of countries based on data stored in a database. 

1.  Fetch data from the [sample database](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases#sample-databases) `users` using a SELECT query `fetchData` to retrieve unique country values.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM users;
```

This query retrieves only unique country values from the "users" table and is used to generate the options for the Select widget dynamically.

2. Next, lets use JavaScript to **transform the data** by adding it to the **Options** property.

```js
{{fetchData.data.map( p => ({label: p.country, value: p.country}))}}
```

The code uses the `map()` function to transform each item in the `fetchUserData` array to an object with `label` and `value` properties, both set to the `country` value of each object in the array.

## Set default value in options

The Default Selected Value property in a widget allows you to specify an initial value for the widget when it's first displayed. This is useful for pre-populating the widget or ensuring that a specific option is selected by default. To use this property, set its value to the value of the desired option from the **Options property**. 

For example, if you want the default selected value to be `RED` and `GREEN,` you can set the **Default Selected Value** property to:

```json
[
  "GREEN",
  "RED"
]
```

## Access selected option
These properties allow you to bind your Multiselect widget with any other widget in queries or JS objects.

* The **selectedOptionValue** in a Multiselect widget is a value that represents the selected option in a  dropdown. It updates when the user selects a new option or the default value changes. 

* The **selectedOptionLabel** in a Multiselect widget represents the label of the selected option in a dropdown. This property is used to display the label of the selected option in the widget and is updated whenever the user selects a different option from the dropdown list or if the default label changes. 

```javascript
{{widget_name.selectedOptionLabel}}
```
---
**Example**: suppose you want to filter data based on count


## Server side filtering	

The Multiselect widget has the option to configure server-side filtering, where search queries are sent to the back-end, and responses are used to populate options on the Multiselect widget. You can implement server-side filtering of options in the Multiselect widget by using the `filterText` binding property.

The **filterText** is a binding property in a Multiselect widget that allows you to implement server-side filtering of options in the dropdown list. When enabling server-side filtering in the widget, please update the default value to contain both `label` and `value` in this format `{"label":<label>, "value": <value>}` if the default value isn't present in the default options.

You can also configure the `onFilterUpdate` event can be configured to handle server-side filtering in the Multiselect widget. It's triggered when the user types in the search bar and provides the search query as an argument. You can use this query to update the options displayed in the widget based on the server response.


## Properties

Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.
