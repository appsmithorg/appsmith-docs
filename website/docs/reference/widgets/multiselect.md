# Multiselect

This page explains how to use a Multiselect widget to allow users to select multiple options from a given list.

## Display static options 

To display static options in a Multiselect widget, you can use the **Options** property.

The options must be specified as an array of objects, where each object has two properties: `label` and `value`. The `label` property represents the text that's displayed to the user, while the `value` property is the actual data that's stored and used in your application. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Blue",
    "value": "BLUE"
  },
  {
    "label": "Green",
    "value": "GREEN"
  },
  {
    "label": "Red",
    "value": "RED"
  }
]
```

### Set default values

The **Default Selected Values** property in a widget allows you to specify an initial value for the widget when it's first displayed. This is useful for pre-populating the widget or ensuring that specific options are selected by default. To use this property, set its value to the value of the desired option from the **Options property**. 

For example, if you want the default selected values to be `RED` and `GREEN,` you can set the **Default Selected Values** property to:

```json
[
  "GREEN",
  "RED"
]
```

## Display options dynamically 

You can dynamically generate options by fetching data from queries or JS functions by binding the response to the **Options** property.


---
**Example 1:** suppose you want to use a Multiselect widget to allow users to select one or more countries from a database, with the dynamic population of options.


1.  Fetch data from the [sample database](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases#sample-databases) `users` using a SELECT query `fetchData` to retrieve distinct country values as `label` and `value`:


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country as label, country as value FROM users;
```

2. In the Multiselect **Options** property, display the data using:

```js
{{fetchData.data}}
```

With this configuration, the Multiselect widget displays a list of unique country values directly from the query. It is recommended to retrieve the data in a structured format directly from the query, as it simplifies the configuration when displaying the options in the Multiselect widget.

---
**Example 2:** if the data retrieved from the query is not in the desired format, you can use JavaScript to transform it before passing it to the Multiselect widget. 

1. Use the `users` table in the sample database and fetch the unique country values using the following `getdata` SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM users;
```

This query retrieves unique country values from the `users` table. The retrieved data is in the form of an array of objects, where each object has a country `key`.

2. Use JavaScript to **transform the data** by adding it to the **Options** property.

```js
{{getdata.data.map( p => ({label: p.country, value: p.country}))}}
```

The code transforms each item in the `getdata` array by using the `map()` function to create a new object with a `label` and `value` property, both set to the country value of each object in the array.

## Access selected options
If you want to retrieve the selected values from a Multiselect widget and bind them to other widgets or JavaScript functions, you can use the following properties:


* **selectedOptionValues**: This property returns the value of the selected options in the Multiselect widget. 

* **selectedOptionLabels**: This property returns the label of the selected options in the Multiselect widget. 

Both properties, `selectedOptionValues` and `selectedOptionLabels`, update automatically when the user selects or deselects a new option in the Multiselect widget.

---
**Example**: suppose you want to filter the table data based on the user-selected countries from a Multiselect widget. 

1. Create a new query called `filterdata` and add a SQL statement to select all the data from the `users` table where the `country` column matches the selected options from a Multiselect widget. 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE country IN ({{"'" + MultiSelect.selectedOptionLabels.join("', '") + "'"}})
LIMIT 10;
```

:::info
When using dynamic binding with queries that contain SQL keywords such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `AND`, and other keywords, a [prepared statement](/learning-and-resources/how-to-guides/how-to-use-prepared-statements#when-not-to-use-prepared-statements-in-appsmith) cannot be used. Therefore, it is recommended to turn off the prepared statement in the `filterdata` query for the Multiselect widget.
:::

2. Display the data by binding the query response to the **Table Data** property of the Table widget `tblUserData`, as shown below:

```js
{{filterdata.data}}
```

3. Set the `onOptionChange` event of the Multiselect widget to run the `filterdata` query. This updates the displayed data in real-time as the user selects or deselects options.
