# MultiSelect

This page explains how to use a MultiSelect widget to allow users to select multiple options from a given list.


## Content properties

These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the widget, allowing users to modify the widget according to their preferences.

### Data

#### Source Data `array<object>`

<dd>

Specify data as an array of objects to display options in the widget. For example:


```js
[
  {
    name: "Blue",
    code: "BLUE"
  },
  {
    name: "Green",
    code: "GREEN"
  },
  {
    name: "Red",
    code: "RED"
  },
];
```

You can dynamically generate options by fetching data from queries or JS functions and binding the response to the **Source Data** property. For example, if you have a query named `fetchData`, you can bind its response using:

```js
{{fetchData.data}}
```

If the retrieved data is not in the desired format, you can use JavaScript to transform the data by adding it to the **Source Data** property, like:

```js
{{fetchData.data.map( p => ({label: p.country, value: p.country}))}}
```


If you are generating options for MutliSelect widget using JS code as shown above, you must define both the [**Label**](#label-string) and [**Value**](#value-string) properties.

</dd>

#### Label `string`

<dd>

Defines the key from the **Source Data** property that specifies the labels for each option in the MultiSelect widget. To define **Label** using code, click the **JS** button next to the property. 

*Example:* If you prefer the label to be displayed in lowercase, you can achieve this using the following code snippet:

```js
{{ item.name.toLowerCase() }}
```
`item.name` represents the Source Data's property containing the label, and the `toLowerCase()` function is applied to convert the label to lowercase.

</dd>

#### Value `string`

<dd>

Defines the key from the **Source Data** property that specifies the values for each option in the MultiSelect widget. Value defined for each option must be unique. To define **Value** using code, click the **JS** button next to the property.

</dd>


#### Default selected value `string`

<dd>

Sets the initial options that are automatically chosen when the widget is loaded. It serves as the default selection unless the user manually selects another option from the list. Multiple values can be provided in a CSV format or an array of strings for a MultiSelect dropdown. For example, if you want the default option to be `Blue` and `Red`, set the **Default Selected Value** property to:

```js
[
  "GREEN",
  "RED"
]
```


</dd>

### Label

#### Text `string`

<dd>

Sets the label of the widget.

</dd>

#### Position `string`

<dd>

Sets the placement of the **Label** in the widget.

*Options*:
- **Left**: The label is placed on the left of the widget.
- **Top**: The label gets placed at the top of the widget.
- **Auto**: The label position is determined based on the height of the widget itself. 

</dd>

#### Alignment `string`

<dd>

Sets the label alignment of the widget when the position selected is **Left**.

</dd>

#### Width (in columns) `number`

<dd>

Sets the width of the label in the widget when the **Left** position is selected.

</dd>

### Search and filters

#### Allow searching `boolean`

<dd>

Enables searching for options within the dropdown list. When this option is enabled, a search input field is displayed in the widget. Additionally, you can control it through JavaScript by clicking on the **JS** next to the property.

</dd>

#### Server side filtering `boolean`

<dd>

Enables server-side filtering via a query request. Use this property when the MultiSelect widget's option data is being bound to a query.

</dd>

#### onFilterUpdate

<dd>

This event allows you to configure one or multiple actions (Framework functions, queries, or JS functions) to be executed when you update the filter text. You can also write custom JavaScript logic for this event by clicking on the **JS** next to the property.

</dd>


### Validations

#### Required `boolean`

<dd>

Enabling this property for a MultiSelect widget makes it a mandatory field, meaning that the user must select a value from the dropdown. When the MultiSelect widget is placed within a Form widget and the **Required** property is enabled, the Form's submit button remains inactive until a value is selected in the MultiSelect widget.

</dd>

### General 

#### Tooltip `string`

<dd>

Sets a tooltip for the widget. You can add hints or extra information about the required input from the user

</dd>

#### Placeholder `string`

<dd>

Sets the placeholder text for the MultiSelect widget. 

</dd>

#### Visible `boolean`

<dd>

Controls the visibility of the widget. If you turn off this property, the widget is not visible in View mode. Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on **JS** next to the **Visible** property to control the widget's visibility conditionally.

For example,  if you want to make the widget visible only when the user checks an item in a Checkbox widget, you can use the following JavaScript expression in the visible property of the MultiSelect widget:

```js
{{Checkbox1.isChecked}}
```

</dd>

#### Disabled `boolean`

<dd>

Prevents users from selecting the widget. Even though the widget remains visible, user input is not permitted. Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on **JS** next to the `Disabled` property to control the widget's disabled state conditionally.

For example, if you want to allow only a specific user to interact with the Multi+-select widget, you can use the following JavaScript expression: 
```js
{{appsmith.user.email=="john@appsmith.com"?false:true}}
```

</dd>


#### Animate Loading `boolean`

<dd>

Controls whether the widget is displayed with a loading animation. When enabled, the widget shows a skeletal animation during the loading process. Additionally, you can control it through JavaScript by clicking on the **JS** next to the property.

</dd>

#### Allow select all `boolean`

<dd>

Controls the visibility of **Select all** option in the dropdown. When enabled, **Select all** option is visible at the top of the dropdown, allowing you to select all the options with one click.

</dd>

#### Height `string`

<dd>

This property determines how the widget's height adjusts to changes in its content. 

*Options*:

- **Fixed:** The height of the widget remains as set using drag and resize.
- **Auto Height:** The widget's height adjusts dynamically in response to changes in its content.
- **Auto Height with limits:** Same as Auto height, with a configurable option to set the minimum and maximum number of rows the widget can occupy.

</dd>

### Events

<dd>

Allows you to configure one or multiple actions (Framework functions, queries, or JS functions) to be executed when the user selects an option in the dropdown list. It enables you to capture the user's input and perform specific actions in response. You can also write custom JavaScript logic for this event by clicking on the **JS** button next to the property.

</dd>

#### onDropdownOpen

<dd>

Allows you to configure one or multiple actions (Framework functions, queries, or JS functions) to be executed when the user opens the dropdown list. For example, you could use the **onDropdownOpen** event to retrieve data from a database, populate the options in the dropdown list, or display additional information to the user. You can also write custom JavaScript logic for this event by clicking on the **JS** button next to the property.

</dd>


#### onDropdownClose 

<dd>

Allows you to configure one or multiple actions (Framework functions, queries, or JS functions) to be executed when the user closes the dropdown list. For example, you could use the **onDropdownClose** event to store the selected option in a database, hide additional information, or reset the widget to its original state. You can also write custom JavaScript logic for this event by clicking on the **JS** button next to the property.

</dd>
