# Multiselect

This document explains how to use a multi-select widget to allow users to select multiple options from a predetermined list.

## Display options manually

To manually display options in a Multiselect widget, you can use the **Options** property. The Options property is used to specify the available options for the user to choose from. It allows you to set both the label and value for each item in the dropdown list. 

The options must be specified as an array of objects, where each object has two properties: `label` and `value`. The `label` property represents the text that's displayed to the user, while the `value` property is the actual data that's stored and used in your application. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Blue",
    "value": "BLUE"
  },
  {
    "label": "Green",
    "value": "GREEN"
  },
  {
    "label": "Red",
    "value": "RED"
  }
]
```

## Display options dynamically 

Instead of creating a predetermined set of options, you can dynamically generate options by fetching data from queries or JS functions by binding the response to the **Options** property.


---
**Example:** suppose you want to use a Multiselect widget to filter the table data and display information related to only certain countries.

1.  Fetch data from the [sample database](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases#sample-databases) `users` using a SELECT query `fetchData` to retrieve distinct country values as `label` and `value`:


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country as label, country as value FROM users;
```

2. In the Multiselect **Options** property, display the data using:

```js
{{fetchData.data}}
```

With this configuration, the Multiselect widget displays a list of unique country values directly from the query. 

### Transform data using JavaScript

If the data retrieved from the database query is not in the desired format, you can use JavaScript to transform it before passing it to the Multiselect widget. 

1. Lets consider using the `users` table in the database and fetch the unique country values using the following `getdata` SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM users;
```

This query retrieves unique country values from the `users` table. The retrieved data is in the form of an array of objects, where each object has a country `key`.

2. Next, lets use JavaScript to **transform the data** by adding it to the **Options** property.

```js
{{getdata.data.map( p => ({label: p.country, value: p.country}))}}
```

The code uses the `map()` function to transform each item in the `getdata` array to an object with `label` and `value` properties, both set to the `country` value of each object in the array.

## Access selected options
If you want to retrieve the selected values from a Multiselect widget and bind them to other widgets or JavaScript objects, you can use the following properties:


* **selectedOptionValues**: This property returns the value of the selected options in the Multiselect widget. It updates automatically when the user selects a new option.

* **selectedOptionLabels**: This property returns the label of the selected options in the Multiselect widget. 

---
**Example**: suppose you want to filter the table data based on the user-selected countries from a Multiselect widget. 

1. Create a new query called `filterdata` and add a SQL statement to select all the data from the `users` table where the `country` column matches the selected options from a Multiselect widget. 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE country IN ({{"'" + MultiSelect.selectedOptionLabels.join("', '") + "'"}})
LIMIT 10;
```
The query filters the `users` table by matching the selected options from the Multiselect widget with the `country` column using the SQL IN operator with a comma-separated string.

:::note
When using dynamic binding with SQL queries containing SQL keywords such as 'SELECT', 'WHERE', 'AND', etc., [**prepared statement**](/learning-and-resources/how-to-guides/how-to-use-prepared-statements#when-not-to-use-prepared-statements-in-appsmith) cannot be used. Therefore, it is recommended to turn off the prepared statement in the `filterdata` query for the Multiselect widget.
:::

2. Display the data by binding the query response to the **Table Data** property of the Table widget `tblUserData`, as shown below:

```js
{{filterdata.data}}
```

3. Now, set the `onOptionChange` event of the Multiselect widget to run the `filterdata` query. Whenever the user selects or deselects an option. This updates the displayed data in real-time as the user selects or deselects options.




## Set default values in options

The **Default Selected Values** property in a widget allows you to specify an initial value for the widget when it's first displayed. This is useful for pre-populating the widget or ensuring that a specific options are selected by default. To use this property, set its value to the value of the desired option from the **Options property**. 

For example, if you want the default selected values to be `RED` and `GREEN,` you can set the **Default Selected Values** property to:

```json
[
  "GREEN",
  "RED"
]
```




## Server side filtering	

Filtering large datasets may degrade performance, so it's recommended to set up server-side filtering	for the widget. This strategy helps to only query the data that you need, instead of pulling records that aren't relevant to you.

To use server-side filtering, you can use the `filterText` reference property, which lets you implement the filtering on the server side. You can also configure the `onFilterUpdate` event to handle the filtering. This event is triggered when the user types in the search bar, and it sends the search query to the server. If you're implementing server-side filtering in your widget, make sure to update the default value to include both `label` and `value`.

For example, if the user types `"un"` in the search bar of a Multiselect widget that displays a list of countries, you can send the search query `"un"` to the server, which can then return only the countries that match the search query, such as the United States and the United Kingdom.

## Properties

Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.
