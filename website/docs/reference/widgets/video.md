## Methods

Widget property setters enable you to modify the values of widget properties at runtime, eliminating the need to manually update properties in the editor.

These methods are asynchronous, and you can use the `.then()` block to ensure execution and sequencing of subsequent lines of code in Appsmith.


#### setVisibility `boolean`

<dd>

Sets the visibility of the widget.

*Example*:

```js
Video1.setVisibility(true)
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Video1.setVisibility(true).then(() => {
  // code to be executed after visibility is set
})

```

</dd>


#### setURL `string`

<dd>

Sets the URL of the video to be displayed in the widget.

*Example*:

```js
Video1.setURL('<https://example.com/video.mp4>')
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Video1.setURL('<https://example.com/video.mp4>').then(() => {
  // code to be executed after URL is set
})
```

</dd>


#### setPlaying `boolean`

<dd>

Sets the playing state of the Video widget.

*Example*:
```js
Video1.setPlaying(true)
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Video1.setPlaying(true).then(() => {
  // code to be executed after playing state is set
})
```
</dd>
