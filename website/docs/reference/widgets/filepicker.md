# Filepicker

This page provides information on using the Filepicker widget, which allows users to select and upload multiple files.

## Content properties

These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the widget, allowing users to modify the widget according to their preferences.


### Basic

#### Allowed file types	`array<string>`

<dd>

Allows you to control the types of files users can upload with the Filepicker widget. It accepts an array of wildcards, MIME types, or specific file extensions, such as `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.gif`. 

_Options_ :

* Any *(allows users to upload files of all the mentioned file types)*
* Images 
* Videos 
* Audio
* Text
* MS Word
* JPEG
* PNG



When JS is enabled, you can provide the data as an array of strings, specifying accepted file types.

_Example_:

```js
[
  "audio/*",
  "text/*",
  "video/*"
]
```

</dd>

:::caution
* Any file exceeding 5 MB is saved as a blob URL, and the upper limit for file size is 100 MB.
* When using the data in a query, it is uploaded in the selected format, despite appearing in the blob URL format when you log the data.
:::

#### Data Format `string`

<dd>

This property allows you to choose the data format of the uploaded files. Appsmith supports various file types and data formats, including:

_Options_:

* **Binary**: Binary files store data in the form of continuous bytes, without a defined reading method.
* **Text**: Text files store data as human-readable characters. 
* **Base64**: Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. Also, use this format if you want to upload images.
* **Array of Object(CSV, XLS, JSON, TSV)**: This data format accommodates various file formats, including CSV, XLS, JSON, and TSV, enabling versatile handling of tabular data. Using large files directly in widgets may lead to a slowdown in the application.


</dd>

#### Infer data types from CSV	`boolean`

<dd>

When enabled, it automatically determines the data types for columns in a CSV file based on content characteristics. This option is only available when the **Array of Object** data format is selected.

</dd>






#### Max no. of files	`number`

<dd>

Sets the maximum number of files that a user can select. The default value is `1`.
</dd>

### Label

#### Text `string`
<dd>
Sets the text on the widget. The default value is `Select Files`.
</dd>

### Validation

These properties define the types of validations available for the FilePicker widget.

#### Required `boolean`
<dd>
Enabling this property makes the Filepicker widget mandatory, requiring users to select a file. When the widget is placed within a Form widget, enabling the **Required** property ensures that the Form's submit button remains disabled until a file is selected.
</dd>

#### Max file size	`number`
<dd>
Use this property to set the size of each file that a user can upload. The default value is set to `5 MB`. 
</dd>

### General

#### Visible `boolean`

<dd>

Controls the visibility of the widget. If you turn off this property, the widget would not be visible in View Mode. Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on **JS** next to the **Visible** property to conditionally control the widget's visibility. The default value for the property is `true`.

For example, if you want to make the widget visible only when the user selects "Yes" from a Select widget, you can use the following JavaScript expression: 
```js
{{Select1.selectedOptionValue === "Yes"}}
```



</dd>

#### Disabled `boolean`

<dd>

Prevents users from selecting the widget. Even though the widget remains visible, user input is not permitted. Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on **JS** next to the **Disabled** property to control the widget's disable state conditionally. The default value for the property is `false`.

For example, if you want to allow only a specific user to fill the input, you can use the following JavaScript expression: 
```js
{{appsmith.user.email=="john@appsmith.com"?false:true}}
```

</dd>

#### Animate Loading `boolean`


<dd>

This property controls whether the widget is displayed with a loading animation. When enabled, the widget shows a skeletal animation during the loading process. Additionally, you can control it through JavaScript by clicking on the <code>JS</code> next to the property. The default value for the property is `true`.

</dd>

### Events

#### onFilesSelected	

<dd>

Allows you to configure one or multiple actions (Framework functions, queries, or JS functions) to be executed when the user select a file through the widget.

</dd>


### Color

#### Button color `string`

<dd>

Represents the color of the button, specified as a [CSS color value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color). When JS is enabled, the font color can be programmatically modified using JavaScript functions.

</dd>

### Border and shadow

#### Border radius `string`

<dd>

Applies rounded corners to the outer edge of the widget. If JavaScript is enabled, you can specify valid [CSS border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) to adjust the radius of the corners.

</dd>

#### Box Shadow `string`
 

<dd>

This property adds a drop shadow effect to the frame of the widget. If JavaScript is enabled, you can specify valid [CSS box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) values to customize the appearance of the shadow.


</dd>

## Reference properties

Reference properties are properties that are not available in the property pane but can be accessed using the dot operator in other widgets or JavaScript functions. They provide additional information or allow interaction with the widget programmatically. For instance, to get the visibility status, you can use `FilePicker1.isVisible`.

#### files `array`

<dd>

The `files` property stores file objects that the user has selected. Each file object contains the file data, which can be accessed through its `data` property.

*Example:*

```js
// Accessing the file data
{{ FilePicker1.files[0].data }}

// Accessing the data format
{{FilePicker1.files[0].dataFormat}}

// Accessing the file name
{{FilePicker1.files[0].name}}

// Accessing multiple files
{{FilePicker1.files}}

// Accessing metadata and data
{{FilePicker1.files[0]}} 


//here [0] represents index of the file.
```

</dd>

#### isValid `boolean`

<dd>

The `isValid` property indicates the validation status of a widget, providing information on whether the widget's current value is considered valid or not.

Example:

```js
{{FilePicker1.isValid}}
```

</dd>

#### isDisabled `boolean`

<dd>

The `isDisabled` property reflects the state of the widget's Disabled setting. It is represented by a boolean value, where true indicates that the widget is not available, and false indicates that it is enabled for user interaction.

Example:

```js
{{FilePicker1.isDisabled}}
```

</dd>


#### isVisible `boolean`

<dd>

The `isVisible` property indicates the visibility state of a widget, with true indicating it is visible and false indicating it is hidden.

Example:

```js
{{FilePicker1.isVisible}}
```

</dd>

#### isDirty `boolean`

<dd>

Indicates whether the FilePicker has been used by the end user during the session. It is `true` if the user has interacted with the FilePicker at least once during their session, and `false` if they haven't used it yet.

Example:

```js
{{FilePicker1.isDirty}}
```


</dd>



## Methods

Widget property setters enable you to modify the values of widget properties at runtime, eliminating the need to manually update properties in the editor.

These methods are asynchronous and return a [Promise](/core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-promises#using-promises-in-appsmith). You can use the .then() block to ensure execution and sequencing of subsequent lines of code in Appsmith.


#### setVisibility(param: boolean): Promise

<dd>

Sets the visibility of the widget.

*Example*:

```js
FilePicker1.setVisibility(true)
```

</dd>


#### setDisabled(param: boolean): Promise

<dd>

Sets the disabled state of the widget.

*Example*:

```js
FilePicker1.setDisabled(false)
```

</dd>
