#### **Text**

It allows you to set the display name for the Datepicker. For example, if you want the user to select a date of joining, you can enter the text as "Date of Joining."

:::tip
You can leave the text empty if you don't want any display name for your Datepicker widget.
:::

#### Position

It allows you to specify the placement of the label. You can select one of the available options:

* Top - It allows you to align the text at the top of the Datepicker.
* Left - It aligns the text to the left of the Datepicker. When you select **Left** alignment, you get additional settings that you can use to control the alignment and define the text's width.
  * Alignment - With the help of alignment, you can define the placement of the text in accordance with the position of the Datepicker. You can choose:
    * Left - It aligns the text to the widget's left boundary that is away from the Datepicker.
    * Right - It aligns the text closer to the Datepicker.
  * Width - With the help of width, you can define the **number of columns** in the **grid** that surrounds the widget. You can specify how close or far the text can be placed to the Datepicker.
* Auto - It automatically adjusts the position of the text based on the Datepicker's height.

:::info
Columns are the dashed lines (-----) that surround a widget when you try to drag and drop it on the canvas.

To select just a month rather than a particular date, you can convert the [**Select widget**](./select.md) into a month picker. Drag a select widget to the canvas and enter the following snippet:

```

```
{{ function()
    { 
        let start_year = 1920; //change start year for year picker 
        let end_year = 2120; //change end year for year picker 
        let years = []; 
        for (let i = start_year;i<= end_year;i++)
            { 
            let current_year_object = { "label":i.toString(), "value":i.toString()}
            years.push(current_year_object) 
            } 
         return years; 
     }
 () }}
```
