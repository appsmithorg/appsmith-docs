# Multi TreeSelect

This page provides information on using the Multi TreeSelect, which allows users to select single or multiple options from a tree-style hierarchical dropdown list.



## Content properties


These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the widget, allowing users to modify the widget according to their preferences.


### Data

#### Options `array<object>`

<dd>

The **Options** property allows you define the options available in the Multi TreeSelect widget. It is represented as an array of objects, where each object contains properties such as `label`, `value`, and optionally `children`.

*Expected data structure:*
```js
[
  {
    "label": "Shoes",
    "value": "SHOES",
    "children": [
      {
        "label": "Sports Shoes",
        "value": "SPORTS_SHOES"
      },
      {
        "label": "Casual Shoes",
        "value": "CASUAL_SHOES"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "label": "Electronics",
    "value": "ELECTRONICS",
    "children": [
      {
        "label": "Laptops",
        "value": "LAPTOPS"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "label": "Clothing",
    "value": "CLOTHING"
  }
]
```

You can **dynamically generate** options by fetching data from queries or JavaScript functions and binding the response to the **Options** property. For example, you have a database that includes a column for product categories (type), as well as other product details such as its name and description.

You can construct a query that retrieves the relevant data and formats it to be used as options, something like:

*Example:*
```sql
SELECT 
  type AS label,
  type AS value,
  JSON_AGG(
    JSON_BUILD_OBJECT(
      'label', (name),
      'value', (name)
    )
  ) AS children
FROM product
GROUP BY type
ORDER BY label;
```

In the **Options** property, display the data using:

```js
{{fetchData.data}}
```

If the retrieved data is not in the desired format, you can use JavaScript to **transform** it before passing it to the widget. For example, you have a database that includes a column for product categories (type), as well as other product details such as its name and description. To transform this data, use:

*Example:*
```js
{{ fetchData.data.reduce((acc, cur) => {
  const group = acc.find(item => item.value === cur.type);
  group ? group.children.push({ label: cur.name, value: cur.name }) : acc.push({ label: cur.type, value: cur.type, children: [{ label: cur.name, value: cur.name }] });
  return acc;
}, []) }}
```

</dd>



#### Default selected values `array`


<dd>

Allows you to specify an initial value(s) for the widget when it's first displayed. This is useful for pre-populating the widget or ensuring that specific options are selected by default. 


For example, if you want the default selected values to be `CLOTHING` and `LAPTOPS`, you can set the **Default Selected Values** property to:

```js
[
  "CLOTHING",
  "LAPTOPS"
]
```

</dd>

```js
{{Select1.selectedOptionValue === "Yes"}}
```

</dd>
