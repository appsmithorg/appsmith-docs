## Properties

Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.

### Widget properties

These properties allow you to edit the widget. All of these properties are present in the property pane of the widget.

| Property | Data type | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **URL**        |  String  | URL of the audio source to play. Supports MP3, WAV, OGG format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Auto Play**     |   Boolean   | Plays audio automatically on page load, without any action from the user.                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Animate Loading**  |   Boolean | Allows you to control a widgetâ€™s animation on the page load.|

### Reference properties

These properties allow you to bind your widget with any other widget in queries or JS objects. For instance, you can use `Audio1.isVisible` to get the visibility status.

| Property | Data type | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **autoPlay**   |   Boolean  | Reflects the state of the widget's **Auto Play** setting.                                                                                 |
| **playState**  |   String  | Shows whether the Audio widget is currently playing sound. Represented by a _(string)_ with value "NOT\_STARTED", "PLAYING," "PAUSED," or "ENDED." |
| **playing**  |   Boolean  | This property provides the playing state of the widget. |

## Events

When the event is triggered, these event handlers can run queries, JS code, or other supported [actions](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions)


| Events      | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **onPlay**  | Sets the action to run when the audio begins playing.   |
| **onPause** | Sets the action to run when the audio is paused.    |
| **onEnd**   | Sets the action to run when the audio ends.            |

## Methods

Widget property setters enable you to modify the values of widget properties at runtime, eliminating the need to manually update properties in the editor.

These methods are asynchronous, and you can use the `.then()` block to ensure execution and sequencing of subsequent lines of code in Appsmith.


#### setPlaying `boolean`

<dd>

Updates the playing state of the Audio widget. When the `setPlaying` method is called with `true`, the audio starts playing, and when called with `false`, the audio stops playing.


*Example*:

```js
Audio1.setPlaying(true)
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Audio1.setPlaying(true).then(() => {
  // Perform additional actions or write code to be executed after the playing state is set
});
```

</dd>


#### setURL `string`

<dd>

Updates the URL of the audio to be played in the audio widget. Provide the desired URL as a string parameter to the `setURL` method. 

*Example*:

```js
Audio1.setURL('<https://example.com/image.mp3>')
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Audio1.setURL('<https://example.com/image.mp3>').then(() => {
  // code to be executed after URL is set
})

```

</dd>


#### setVisibility `boolean`

<dd>

Updates the visibility of the Audio widget.

*Example*:

```js
Audio1.setVisibility(true)
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Audio1.setVisibility(true).then(() => {
  // code to be executed after visibility is set
})

```

</dd>
