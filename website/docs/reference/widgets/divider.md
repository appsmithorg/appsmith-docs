# Divider

The Divider widget is used to visually separate or compartmentalise different parts of your application.


## Properties

Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.

### Widget properties

These properties allow you to edit the Divider widget. All of these properties are present in the property pane of the widget. The following table lists all the widget properties.

| Property            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Orientation**     | Sets whether the line of the widget is oriented horizontally or vertically. With JS enabled, accepted values are "horizontal" or "vertical."                                                           |
| **Visible**         | Control widget's visibility on the page. When turned off: The widget isn't visible when the app is published. It appears translucent when in Edit mode.                                         |
| **Animate Loading** | When turned off, the widget loads without any skeletal animation. You can use a toggle switch to turn it on/off. You can also turn it off/on using JavaScript by enabling the JS label next to it. |

### Binding properties

These properties allow you to bind your Divider widget with any other widget in queries or JS objects. The following table lists all the binding properties.

## Methods

Widget property setters enable you to modify the values of widget properties at runtime, eliminating the need to manually update properties in the editor.

These methods are asynchronous, and you can use the `.then()` block to ensure execution and sequencing of subsequent lines of code in Appsmith.


#### setVisibility `boolean`

<dd>

Sets the visibility of the widget.

*Example*:

```js
Divider1.setVisibility(true)
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Divider1.setVisibility(true).then(() => {
  // code to be executed after visibility is set
})
```

</dd>
