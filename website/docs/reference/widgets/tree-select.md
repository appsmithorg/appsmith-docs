# Treeselect

This document explains how to use a Treeselect widget to allow users to select single option from a hierarchical list of predetermined options.

## Display options manually

To manually display options in a Treeselect widget, you can use the **Options** property. The Options property is used to specify the available options for the user to choose from. It allows you to set both the label and value for each item in the dropdown list.

To display data, options must be specified as an array of objects. Each object represents an option and must include a `label` and a `value`. If the option has **child** options, the object must also include a `children array` containing the child options in the same format.

```js
[
  {
    "label": "Blue",
    "value": "BLUE",
    "children": [
      {
        "label": "Dark Blue",
        "value": "DARK BLUE"
      },
      {
        "label": "Light Blue",
        "value": "LIGHT BLUE"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "label": "Green",
    "value": "GREEN"
  },
  {
    "label": "Red",
    "value": "RED"
  }
]
```

## Display options dynamically

Instead of creating a predetermined set of options, you can dynamically generate options by fetching data from queries or JS functions by binding the response to the Options property.

For example, suppose you have a database of device assets with different categories of products and their make, such as `laptop` with the make `Opela`. You can create a query that fetches data in the desired format and bind it to the **Options** property of a Treeselect widget.

</figure>




### Transform data using JavaScript

If the data retrieved from the query is not in the desired format, you can use JavaScript to transform it before passing it to the Treeselect widget.

---
**Example**: suppose you want to use a Treeselect widget to filter table data based on country and gender. For instance, selecting "Canada" as the parent option and "male" as the child option would display information on all Canadian males.

1. Fetch data from the [sample database](core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases#sample-databases) `users` using a SELECT query `fetchData` to retrieve distinct country values:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM users LIMIT 10;
```
2. Next, lets use JavaScript to **transform the data** by adding it to the **Options** property.

```js
{{fetchData.data.map( p => ({
      label: p.country,
      value: p.country,
      children: [
        {label: "Male", value: `Male_${p.country}`},
        {label: "Female", value: `Female_${p.country}`}
      ]
   }))
}}
```

The JavaScript code transforms data into a specific format required by the Treeselect widget. It maps through `fetchData` data and creates an array of objects, where each object represents a country with two child options for `Male` and `Female`.

### Set default value in option

The **Default Selected Value** property in a widget allows you to specify an initial value for the widget when it's first displayed. This is useful for pre-populating the widget or ensuring that a specific options are selected by default. To use this property, set its value to the value of the desired option from the **Options** property.

```js
[
  {
    "label": "Blue",
    "value": "BLUE",
    "children": [
      {
        "label": "Dark Blue",
        "value": "DARK BLUE"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "label": "Green",
    "value": "GREEN"
  }
]
  ```

For example, if you want the default selected values to be `Dark Blue`, you can set the **Default Selected Value** property to: `DARK BLUE`.


### Access selected option

If you want to retrieve the selected values from a Treeselect widget and bind them to other widgets or JavaScript objects, you can use the following properties:

* **selectedOptionValue**: This property returns the value of the selected option in the Treeselect widget. It updates automatically when the user selects a new option.

```javascript
{{widget_name.selectedOptionValue}}
```

* **selectedOptionLabel**: This property returns the label of the selected option in the Treeselect widget.

```javascript
{{widget_name.selectedOptionLabel}}
```

## Properties

Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.


### Widget properties

These properties allow you to edit the Modal widget. All of these properties are present in the property pane of the widget.

|  Property   | Data type |  Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
