# Tree-select

A tree-select widget captures user inputs from a specified list of permitted options in which each option can then have child options associated with it.

### Displaying Data

Tree-select options can be populated from a data source like an API / Query by transforming the incoming data to an array of \\(label, value\\). The transformation can be performed using javascript. So if the data is an array, we can transform it using the [**Array.map**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\_Objects/TypedArray/map) function.

```
// Query1.data is assumed to be an array here
{{ Query1.data.map((row) => {
      return { label: row.name, value: row.id, children: {label: row.child.label, value: row.child.value}}
   })
}}
```

### Filtering Data

A Tree-select widget can filter a dataset based on the user's input. The selected value can be passed to an API using`{{ TreeSelect1.selectedOptionValue }}` .

### **Form Submission**

Tree-select widgets can capture from a fixed set of options inside a form such as gender, role, status.

:::info
Some forms need to be pre-filled data from a table or API. We can bind the data to the default property to enable this
:::

```
{{ Table1.selectedRow.gender }}
/**
* Binding this to the default option will update the selected option
* of the TreeSelect widget with the gender of the selected row in Table1
*/
```

## Properties

Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.

### Widget Properties

These properties allow you to edit the widget. All these properties are present in the property pane of the widget. The following table lists all the widget properties.

| Property                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Options**               | It lets you set labels and values for different items/options in the list of the tree select widget. Options must be specified as an array of objects with a label and value property. The tree structure can be added to any option by adding the children field that should be an object. |
| **Default Value**         | Sets a default option that will be captured as user input unless the user changes it.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Events

They are a set of actions that you can perform on the widget. The following table lists the actions:

| Events             | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **onOptionChange** | Triggers an action when a user selects an option. See a list of [supported actions](../appsmith-framework/widget-actions/). |
| **onDropdownOpen** | Sets the action to be run when the user opens the dropdown. See a list of [supported actions](../appsmith-framework/widget-actions/). |
| **onDropdownClose** | Sets the action to be run when the user opens the dropdown. See a list of [supported actions](../appsmith-framework/widget-actions/). |

### Label

The property hosts a group of configurations that you can use to associate a display name and define a placement for the widget. These properties are usually useful when you want to design forms that follow a defined alignment for your form fields and give a professional look to your forms. Below are the properties that you can use:

| Label         | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Text**      | Sets the label of the widget.                                |
| **Position**  | Sets the label position of the widget.                       |
| **Alignment** | Sets the label alignment of the widget.                      |
| **Width**     | Sets the label width of the widget as the number of columns. |

Let's understand these properties in detail.

#### **Text**

It allows you to set the display name for the Tree-select. For example, if you want the user to select a category and its subcategories of fruits, you can enter the text as "Fruits."

:::tip
You can leave the text empty if you don't want any display name for your Tree-select widget.
:::

#### **Position**

It allows you to specify the placement of the label. You can select one of the available options:

* Top - It allows you to align the text at the top of the Tree-select.
* Left - It aligns the text to the left of the Tree-select. When you select **Left** alignment, you get additional settings that you can use to control the alignment and define the text's width.
  * Alignment - With the help of alignment, you can define the placement of the text in accordance with the position of the Tree-select. You can choose:
    * Left - It aligns the text to the widget's left boundary that is away from the Tree-select.
    * Right - It aligns the text closer to the Tree-select.
  * Width - With the help of width, you can define the **number of columns** in the **grid** that surrounds the widget. You can specify how close or far the text can be placed to the Tree-select.
* Auto - It automatically adjusts the position of the text based on the Tree-select's height.

:::info
Columns are the dashed lines (-----) that surround a widget when you try to drag and drop it on the canvas.
