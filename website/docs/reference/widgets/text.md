These properties enable you to edit the text widget. All these properties are present in the property pane of the widget. The following table lists all the widget properties.

| **Enable Scroll**   | It enables scrolling within a widget's set boundary. It helps you not truncate long text and lets you display it inside a small area on the app.                                           |
| **Truncate text**   | It truncates the text that goes beyond the text box size.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Visible**         | It controls the widget's visibility on the page. When turned off, the widget would not be visible when the app is published.                                                                |
| **Animate Loading** | Control’s widget’s loading animation on the page. When turned off, the widget will load without any skeletal animation. This can be controlled with JS until all the widgets are rendered. |
| **Disable link**    | It parses any link in the widget as standard text.                                                                                                                                         |
| [**Height**](/reference/widgets/#height)        | It configures how a widget’s height reacts to content changes. It has three possible configurations:<br/>**Fixed**: The height of the widget remains as set using drag and resize.<br/>**Auto Height**: The height of the widget reacts to content changes.<br/>  **Auto Height with limits**: Same as Auto height, with a configurable option to set the minimum and maximum number of rows that can be occupied by the widget.                                      |

Let's understand the widget properties in detail.

#### Text

The `Text` field takes the input for the text widget. You can also add `HTML` code in the Text field manually or dynamically to render it in the widget.

:::info
Text field can only render inline CSS. If you want to use external CSS, we suggest using the [iFrame widget.](iframe.md)

#### Truncate Text

This property shortens the text in the text box and further adds three ellipses at the bottom left of the widget. Clicking on the three ellipses opens up a pop-up showing all the text inside the text widget. It's enabled by default and truncation will only be applied if the text is longer than what can fit inside the given widget area.

#### Visible

`Visible` controls the widget’s visibility on the app’s page. The widget would not be visible on the published app if you turn off this property. You can also write a `JS`\` code to link Visible’s functionality to a user action. Click on `JS` next to the Visible to write JavaScript code.

For example, let’s drag a checkbox widget `checkbox1` onto the canvas and bind it to the `Visible` property. To enable the `Visible` when the user checks the checkbox, add the following JavaScript code:

```
{{Checkbox1.isChecked}}
```

When you tick the checkbox, it will enable the Visible property, and the text widget will be visible in the app.

#### Disable link

It prevents the input text from being parsed as a link. You can also write a `JS` code to link Disable the link’s functionality to a user action. Click on `JS` next to the `Disable link` to write JavaScript code.

For example, let’s drag a checkbox widget `checkbox1` onto the canvas and bind it to the `Disable link` property. To enable the `Disable link` when the user checks the checkbox, add the following JavaScript code:

```
{{Checkbox1.isChecked}}
```

When you tick the checkbox, it will enable the Disable link property, and the input will be parsed as text.
