## Display static text

To display static text enter the desired text directly into the `Text` property. The text remains the same until manually updated or edited. 

This method is useful when you need to display fixed information, such as **instructions** or **labels**, that don't change based on user interactions. 

Additionally, you can use **HTML code** in the Text field to customize the appearance of the displayed text. Text field can only render inline CSS. To use external CSS, it's recommended to use the [Iframe widget](/reference/widgets/iframe). For instance, you can use:

```js
<p style="color:blue;">Hello World</p>
```

## Display dynamic text

To display dynamic text that changes based on user interactions or data from external sources, you can use binding values to connect different widgets and their properties.


For example, if you have a Table widget with a list of tasks, and you want to display the details of the currently selected task in a Text widget:

```js
{{Table1.selectedRow.task}}
```

## Download text content

To download the content in a Text widget,  add a Button widget and use the [Download](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions/download) method on the `onClick` event as shown below.

```js
{{download(Text1.text,'LoremIpsum.txt','text/plain')}}
```
This code downloads the text in the Text widget as a plain text file named `LoremIpsum.txt`. You can customize the filename and type by adjusting the parameters in the download function.


## Properties
Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.

### Widget properties
These properties are present in the property pane of the widget. The following table lists all the widget properties.


| Property            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |

You can choose between Scroll, Truncate and None.<br/>**Scroll**:  This option enables scrolling within the boundaries of the Text widget.<br/>**Truncate**: This option shortens text in a Text widget and adds ellipses at the bottom left. Clicking on the ellipses reveals a pop-up with the full text if it exceeds the widget area.
| **Visible**         | Controls the widget's visibility on the page. When turned off, the widget would not be visible when the app is published.                                                                |

| **Height**      | It configures how a widgetâ€™s height reacts to content changes. It has three possible configurations:<br/>**Fixed**: The height of the widget remains as set using drag and resize.<br/>**Auto Height**: The height of the widget reacts to content changes.<br/>  **Auto Height with limits**: Same as Auto height, with a configurable option to set the minimum and maximum number of rows that can be occupied by the widget.                                      |
