# List

You can use the list widget to display items  from a dataset in repeating sections, automatically iterating within the array of objects without writing any code . Each list item can contain other widgets to display data or capture user input.

Currenlty,you can only use widgets to display the data like images, text in the list.

##  List components

Typically, a list widget is a collection of other widgets that you can embed to display data. Once you drag the list widget on the canvas, you can see it has embedded widgets [ image](./image.md) and two[ texts](./text.md) available. You can add more widgets as per your requirement. Add the widgets only on the first list item container. The widgets get replicated for the other list items whenever the data renders automatically. 

##  Display data in list items

The `Items` are used to bind your dataset with the list widget. Either you want to iterate over static or dynamic data generated by executing a database Query/API call.

To have a dynamic data binding for the list widget, you can use the **Connect Data** button on the right bar or choose the Queries/API/JS functions from the left navigation bar available under the **Explorer** tab.

### Data mapping

You can see a box displaying the static JSON data. You can replace the static JSON in the items pane or bind the query/API/JS response, and the list widget uses the data for generating the list items.

#### Manual data

You can add static JSON data in the `items` for generating the list items for the widget.

**Example:** see the JSON snippet below, there is a collection of books with details like `bookId`, `bookName`, `bookImage`, `category`, `author`, `publishedDate`, and `price`.

```javascript
[

  {

    "bookId": "001",

    "bookName": "Artificial Intelligence for Business Leaders",

    "bookImage": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511Y1LSr0JL.jpg",

    "price": "INR 599"

  },

  {

    "bookId": "002",

    "bookName": "Bootstrap 4 Quick Start",

    "bookImage": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GTBaVKAyL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",

    "price": "INR 439.90”

 }

]
```

Replace the above JSON snippet in the items pane. To display the data in the list widget, add three text widgets and one image widget. Add the widgets on the **first item** of the list widget.

Follow the steps below bind each JSON field to the widgets embedded in the list:

* Select the Image widget and add  `{{currentItem.bookImage}}`under `Image` in the property pane. Please note that `currentItem` refers to the item read from the data collection. . `bookImage` is the JSON attribute.
* You can now see image in the list item, as the image widget renders the image available on the URL supplied in JSON.

Similarly, you can bind bookName, bookId, and price to the embedded widgets in the list widget. Once you link the data, you can see that the list widget displays the data for the JSON.

#### Dynamic data

If you wish to bind the dynamic response of the queries, then you can use mustache syntax (`{{ }}`) to embed the same. For example, You have written a query `“GetAllEmployees”` then to bind the response use `{{GetAllEmployees.data}}`. Typically, you have a format of `{{QUERY_NAME.data}}` to bind the data returned by the query.
If you are binding the dynamic response of your query or API to the list widget, remember to use the query columns or API response object’s attributes to map to the individual widget by using `currentItem.<attribute_or_column_name>`.

### Server Side Pagination

You can use server-side pagination when a client receives only a subset of data from large datasets. It allows you to define the data limit that a Query or an API call can render. Thus, allowing you to paginate the data and determine the pagination boundaries.[ Read more on server-side pagination to paginate your large data sets](/reference/widgets/table#server-side-pagination).



## Properties

Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.

### Widget properties

These properties allow you to name, edit the List widget. All these properties are present in the property pane of the widget. The following table lists all the widget properties.
