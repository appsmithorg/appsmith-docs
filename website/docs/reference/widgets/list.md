# List

The List widget provides a way to iterate over a structured dataset(array of objects) and display the data in repeating sections without writing any code. Each list item can contain other widgets to display data or capture user input.

:::info
Although you can add many other widgets inside the List widget, currently, Appsmith fully supports only the Text and Image widgets inside a List.
:::


##  List components

Typically, a List widget is a collection of other widgets you can embed to display data or capture user input. Once you drag a List widget on the canvas, it has embedded Image and Text widgets by default. You can add more widgets per your requirement on the first list item container. The widgets get replicated on the other list items automatically when a dataset is connected to the List. 

##  Display data in list items

The `Items` property can bind your dataset to the List widget. You can bind static or dynamic data generated by executing a query or a JS function.

### Static data mapping

You can display static JSON data in the `Items` property for generating the list items.

**Example:** see the JSON snippet below; a collection of books has details like `bookId`, `bookName`, and `price`.

```javascript
[
  {
    "bookId": "001",
    "bookName": "Artificial Intelligence for Business Leaders",
    "bookImage": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511Y1LSr0JL.jpg",
    "price": "INR 599"
  },
  {
    "bookId": "002",
    "bookName": "Bootstrap 4 Quick Start",
    "bookImage": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GTBaVKAyL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",
    "price": "INR 439.90‚Äù
 }
]
```

To display the data in the List widget, add three Text widgets and one Image widget in the first list item.

Follow the steps below to bind each JSON field to the widgets embedded in the List:

* Select the Image widget and add  `{{currentItem.bookImage}}` under `Image` in the property pane. `currentItem` refers to the data for a particular item. All the list items get populated based on the corresponding data in the JSON object.
* You can now see the image in the list item, as the image widget renders the image available on the URL supplied in JSON.

Similarly, you can bind `bookName`, `bookId`, and `price` to the embedded widgets in the List widget.

### Dynamic data mapping

If you want to bind the response from a query or a JS function, then you can use mustache syntax (`{{ }}`). Use the format of `{{QUERY_NAME.data}}` to bind the data returned by the query. For example, You a query `GetAllEmployees`, bind the response in the `Items` property as shown below:

```javascript

{{GetAllEmployees.data}}
```

To learn how to bind data from JS functions, see [Display Data from JS function](/core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#display-data-from-async-js-function)

If you are binding the dynamic data to the List widget, remember to use the  columns/attribute name to map to the individual widget as shown below:
 
```javascript

{{currentItem.<attribute_or_column_name>}}
```

## Server-side pagination

Lists are often required to display large data sets from queries, but browsers can only sometimes load all the data present in the database or might do so slowly. You can use server-side pagination when a client receives only a subset of data from large datasets. It allows you to define the data limit that a query call can render. Thus, allowing you to paginate the data and determine the pagination boundaries.

Follow the steps below to paginate the responses and request smaller chunks of data at a time:

1. Enable the Server Side Pagination property for the List.
2. Call the query on the onPageChange event listener.
3. Set the LIMIT and OFFSET clause in the query:

```javascript
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT {{ List1.pageSize }} OFFSET {{ (List1.pageNo - 1) * List1.pageSize }}
```

## Access list items

You can reference the values inside each item selected in the list using the `selectedItem` property as shown below:

```javascript

{{listName.selectedItem.fieldName}}
```

**Example**: in the preceding example, if you want to display the book name of the selected item in a Text widget of `List1`, bind it in the **Text** property of the Text widget as shown below 

```javascript

{{List1.selectedItem.bookName}}
```

To access the index of the selected item in the list, you can use the following:

```javascript

{{listName.selectedItemIndex}}
```

## Properties

Properties allow you to customize the widget, connect it to other widgets and trigger events on user actions.
