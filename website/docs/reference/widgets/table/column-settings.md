# Column

You can customize each table column separately by accessing properties through the gear icon ⚙️ in the table's properties pane. This includes editing existing column properties, adding new custom columns, rearranging columns, and hiding columns.

## Content properties

These properties are customizable options available in the property pane of the Column settings.

### Column Types

This property allows users to select the appropriate column type for their table. Each column type serves a specific function and enhances the table's interactivity. The available column types are as follows:

- **Button**: A clickable cell that triggers an onClick event. The triggeredRow reference property retrieves data from the corresponding row.

- **Checkbox**: Represents a binary value (True/False) with checked and unchecked states. This column type can be made editable by enabling the Editable property in the column settings.

- **Icon Button**: A clickable button with an icon instead of text. It triggers an onClick event, and the triggeredRow reference property retrieves data from the corresponding row.

- **Image**: Displays an image by interpreting the cell value as an image source URL or base64 data. It shows Invalid Image if the data is not valid.

- **Menu Button**: A group of buttons that expands into a menu. Menu items can be added dynamically using the Menu Items Source as Dynamic, with `{{currentRow}}` referencing inside the Source Data property.

- **Number**: Used for numeric data and supports inline editing. It can be made editable by enabling the Editable property in the column settings.

- **Plain Text**: Represents data with readable characters. It supports inline editing and can be made editable by enabling the Editable property in the column settings.

- **Switch**: Allows users to toggle a single item on or off, using binary values. It supports inline editing and can be made editable by enabling the Editable property in the column settings.

- **URL**: Interprets the cell value as a hyperlink, allowing users to click on the cell to open the corresponding URL in a new browser tab. It requires the domain and suffix of the URL.

- **Video**: Displays videos within a table. To add a video, provide a source file path or URL from supported platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, and others.

- **Date**: Allows custom formatting options for date and time information. You can format and display the date using the Date Format and Display Format properties, and it supports inline editing.

- **Select**: Allows users to select an option from a predefined list of choices. The Options property should be an array of objects with label and value properties. This column type can only be displayed or edited when the Editable property is enabled.

### Computed value

In the Table widget, computed value is a column property that allows you to display and manipulate the table data using JavaScript expressions. To make use of this feature, you can use the `currentRow` property within the column settings.

The `currentRow` property is automatically generated by default in the Table widget when you add data to the table. For instance, the computed value of a column named `dob` that displays the date of birth for each row would be `{{currentRow['dob']}}`. Additionally, you can also create custom expressions that compute new values based on the data in the current row.

----
**Example**: suppose you have a table with a `name` column and a `gender` column. If you want to add a prefix of `Mr.` or `Mrs.` to the names in the `name` column based on the data in the `gender` column, you can use a computed value.

1.  Fetch data from the sample **users** database using a SELECT query `fetchData` to retrieve the data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
```
2. In the Table's **Table Data** property, display the data using:

```
{{fetchData.data}}
```

3. Select the `name` column from the list of columns, and add following code in the **Computed Value** property:

```js
{{currentRow.gender === "male" ? "Mr " + currentRow.name : "Mrs " + currentRow.name}}
```

The code uses a ternary operator to add a prefix of `Mr.` or `Mrs.` to the name column based on the value of the gender column in the current row.

## Cell Background Color (Column Color)


You can style each column type from the style property pane, including options to change column color. However, if you need more advanced customization, such as changing table color/column color, you can use the `currentRow` and `currentIndex` references to create custom color expressions. These expressions enable you to conditionally change color and style of individual cells based on their content, offering more flexibility than simply applying a static style to an entire column.

For example, lets say you have a column named `status` that reflects `approved` and `pending` values. You can set the color for these values using the following expression in the **Cell Background** property:

```js
{{currentRow.status === "approved" ? "#22c55e" : "#facc15"}}
```
If you want to keep the same background color for an entire row, you can use the same custom style expression in each column **Cell Background** property.

## Editable

When enabled, this property allows users to modify a field or cell. You can then use the Column's **onSubmit** or **onClick** event to run a query to update the data. 

Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on *JS* next to the **Editable** property to control it conditionally. If you are using JS, make sure to enable the **Editable checkbox** at the Table column level before adding your code.

<dd>

*Example*: if you want to allow only certain users to edit the Table:

* Enable the Editable property at the Table Column level.

* Open the column settings, click *JS* for the **Editable** property, and add your code.

```javascript
{{appsmith.user.email === 'john@appsmith.com' ? true : false}}
```

This code checks if the email of the logged-in user is `john@appsmith.com`. If it is, the property is set to true, making the column editable. If it is not, the property is set to false, keeping the column non-editable.

</dd>

#### Date Format `String`
<dd>
Specifies the date format of the incoming data specified in the Computed Value property. For example, if the incoming date is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` and the option selected in the Date Format property is `DD/MM/YYYY`, it cannot parse the date and displays 'Invalid date' in the column.
</dd>

#### Display Format `String`
<dd>
Specifies how the date information should be displayed to the user. For example, if the incoming date is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` but the Display Format property is set to `DD/MM/YYYY`, the date information would be displayed to the user in the desired format.
</dd>



## Column types
