# Column

This page explains how to customize each table column separately by accessing a range of properties available through the gear icon located in the table's properties pane. You can edit the properties of existing columns, including their name, data type, and computed value. Additionally, you can add new custom columns, rearrange columns, and hide columns as needed.

### Computed value

In the Table widget, computed values refer to a column property that allows you to access and manipulate the displayed value using JavaScript expressions. This property can only be accessed within the column settings. You can use the `currentRow` property to access each row's column values.

For instance, suppose you have a table with a column named `dob` that displays the date of birth for each row. By using the `{{currentRow['dob']}}` reference, you can access and display the data for the `dob` column in each row. With this reference, you can also create custom expressions that compute new values based on the data in the current row.

----
**Example**: suppose you have a table with a `name` column and a `gender` column. If you want to add a prefix of `Mr.` or `Mrs.` to the names in the `name` column based on the data in the `gender` column, you can use a computed value.

1.  Fetch data from the [sample database](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases#sample-databases) `users` using a SELECT query `fetchData` to retrieve the data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
```
2. In the Table's **Table Data** property, display the data using:

```
{{fetchData.data}}
```

3. Select the `name` column from the list of columns, and add following code in the **Computed Value** property:

```js
{{currentRow.gender === "male" ? "Mr " + currentRow.name : "Mrs " + currentRow.name}}
```

The code uses a ternary operator to add a prefix of `Mr.` or `Mrs.` to the name column based on the value of the gender column in the current row.

## Edit table


To edit and update table data directly from the UI, you can use Inline editing. To enable inline editing for a table, you can make individual columns editable by checking the **Editable** checkbox in the Columns section of the Table widget properties panel. Once inline editing is enabled, you can double-click on a cell to edit its contents. 

To update the data in a table, you can set the **onSubmit** event for each individual column. This event can be used to perform an action, such as updating a database, when the edited data cell is saved.

If you select Multi-Row from the **Update mode** property, you can edit multiple rows at the same time. The data would be automatically updated as you make changes.

Learn more about [Inline editing](/reference/widgets/table/inline-editing).

## Freeze column

The Freeze Columns feature allows you to freeze the columns of the table while keeping the rest of the table scrollable. This can be useful when you have a large table with many columns and want to keep some of the important columns always visible.

You can freeze columns by turning on the **Allow Column Freeze** property and selecting to freeze a column on either the left or right side of the table. You can also freeze or unfreeze columns via individual column properties.

## Column type

This property allows you to select the type of cell to use in the column. Currently, the following column types are available:
