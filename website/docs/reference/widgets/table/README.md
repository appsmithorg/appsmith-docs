# Table

This page provides information on using the Table widget to display data in tabular format, trigger actions based on user interaction, and work with paginated data sets of any size.

<VideoEmbed host="youtube" videoId="-rzePEV2QQ8" title="Using the Table Widget" caption="Using the Table Widget"/>

## Content properties


These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the widget, allowing users to modify the widget according to their preferences.


### Data

#### Table data `array<object>`

<dd>

Allows you to connect the Table widget to your datasource. To connect your datasource to the Table widget, click on **Connect data** and select your datasource or query. 

If you don't have a query, you can choose your datasource, select the desired table or collection, and specify the searchable property. Appsmith would automatically generate a query for you, enabling features such as server-side pagination, search capability, and the ability to edit and add new rows in the table.


:::note
Currently, this feature is compatible with PostgreSQL and MongoDB datasources. 
:::

Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on **JS** to write bindings for the table data. The data should be specified as an array of objects, where each object in the array represents a row, and the properties of the object represent the columns in the table. In the given example format, the table has three columns: `step`, `task`, and `status`. 

*Expected data structure:*
```js
[
  {
    "step": "#1",
    "task": "Drop a table",
    "status": "approved"
  },
  {
    "step": "#2",
    "task": "Create a query fetch_users with the Mock DB",
    "status": "pending"
  },
  {
    "step": "#3",
    "task": "Bind the query using => fetch_users.data",
    "status": "pending"
  }
]
```

You can **dynamically generate** a table by fetching data from queries or JavaScript functions and binding the response to the **Table Data** property. For example, if you have a query named `fetchData`, you can bind its response using:

*Example:*
```js
{{fetchData.data}}
```
If the retrieved data is not in the desired format, you can use JavaScript to **transform** it before passing it to the Table widget, like:

*Example:*
```js
{{fetchData.data.users.map((user) => {
  return {
    name: user.name,
    email: user.email
    };
  });
}}
```


</dd>


#### Columns `array`

<dd>


The **Columns** property is automatically populated based on the **Table Data**. To access the column settings, you can click on the gear icon ⚙️ in the properties pane. This would enable you to edit existing column properties, add new custom columns, rearrange the columns, and hide columns.

Learn more about [Column](/reference/widgets/table/column-settings).


</dd>

#### Editable `boolean`

<dd>

The **Editable** property, available within the **Columns** property, is a checkbox property that allows users to modify specific fields or cells in the table. By enabling inline editing and marking columns as editable, users can update the data directly from the UI by double-clicking on the desired cell.

Learn more about [Inline editing](/reference/widgets/table/inline-editing).

</dd>

#### Update mode `string`

<dd>

Determines how edited cells are saved in the table.

*Options:*
* **Single row**: Cells can be saved using the **Save/Discard** column buttons.
* **Multi row**: Cells can be saved by using an **onSubmit** event of the column or through an external button widget.
 
</dd>

#### Primary key column `string`

<dd>

Allows you to assign a unique column that helps maintain `selectedRows` and `triggeredRows` based on its value. This property also affects the performance of caching the dataset for quicker loading and access.

</dd>

### Pagination

#### Show pagination `boolean`

<dd>

Determines whether the pagination feature is displayed in the table header, allowing users to navigate through different pages of the table.
</dd>

#### Server side pagination `boolean`

<dd>

Allows you to implement pagination by limiting the number of results fetched per query request. 

Appsmith can handle query responses of up to 5 MB. To display large datasets and optimise performance, use server-side pagination. It can be implemented using [Offset-based-pagination](#Offset_edition) or [Cursor-based pagination](#Cursor-based-pagination).



</dd>

#### Total Records `number`

<dd>

It is a number value that is displayed in the table header to inform the user about the total number of records in the table. This property is only visible when Server Side Pagination is enabled.

For instance, you can create a Count query to retrieve the total number of records from your datasource. You can then call this query in the **Total Records** property using the, like:

*Example:*
```js
{{Total_record_query.data[0].count}}
```

</dd>

#### onPageChange

<dd>

Sets the [actions](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions) that would be triggered whenever the user navigates to a different page of the table, either by clicking on the pagination buttons.

</dd>

#### onPageSizeChange

<dd>

Sets the [actions](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions) to be executed when the height of the table is changed. This event is typically triggered by developers working on the app and not by end users. It can be useful, for example, to dynamically set a limit in your query based on the new table height.

</dd>

### Search & filters

#### Allow searching `boolean`

<dd>

When enabled, the search bar is displayed, allowing users to search for specific data within the table.
</dd>

#### Client side search `boolean`

<dd>

Determines the search behavior of the search bar in the table header. When enabled, the search bar would only search within the data that is currently loaded in the table. If disabled, the search bar would search across the entire data set.

</dd>

#### Default search text `string`

<dd>

Allows you to set the default search query for the search bar in the table header.

</dd>

#### onSearchTextChanged

</dd>

#### onSort

<dd>

Allows you to specify the [action](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions) to be executed when the user sorts the data in the table.

</dd>

### Adding a row

#### Allow adding a row `boolean`

<dd>

Adds a button to the table that allows users to add new rows of data. Users can input data in editable columns, and you can use the onSave event to update the table's data source and save the changes made by the user.

## Methods

Widget property setters enables you to modify the values of widget properties at runtime, eliminating the need to manually update properties in the editor.

These methods are asynchronous, and you can use the `.then()` block to ensure execution and sequencing of subsequent lines of code in Appsmith.


#### setVisibility `boolean`

<dd>

Sets the visibility of the widget.

*Example*:

```js
Table1.setVisibility(true)
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Table1.setVisibility(true).then(() => {
  // code to be executed after visibility is set
})
```

</dd>

#### setData `array<object`

<dd>

Sets the data to be displayed in the Table widget.

*Example*:

```js
Table1.setData([{ name: 'John', age: 36 }, { name: 'Jane', age: 28 }])
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Table1.setData([{ name: 'John', age: 36 }, { name: 'Jane', age: 28 }]).then(() => {
  // code to be executed after data is set
})
```

</dd>



#### setSelectedRowIndex `number`

<dd>

 Sets the selected row index of the table widget.

*Example*:

```js
Table1.setSelectedRowIndex(2)
```

To perform sequential actions, use the `.then()` block for execution.

```js
Table1.setSelectedRowIndex(2).then(() => {
  // code to be executed after selected row index is set
})
```

</dd>


## Server-side pagination
Appsmith can handle query responses of up to 5 MB. To display large datasets and optimise performance, use server-side pagination. It can be implemented using Offset-based pagination or Cursor-based pagination.


<Tabs queryString="current-edition">
<TabItem label="Offset-based pagination" value="Offset_edition">


 Offset-based pagination works by using the page number and size to calculate the offset of records to fetch from a database or API. 

1. Fetch data from the sample **users** database using `pageSize` and `pageOffset`  reference properties to implement pagination.

   ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users LIMIT {{ Table1.pageSize }} OFFSET {{ Table1.pageOffset }}; 
   ```
 In an API query, the page number can be passed as a query parameter to retrieve the corresponding subset of data, as shown in the example URL:

   ```
   https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?page={{Table1.pageNo}}
   ```

2. Enable the **Server-side pagination** property in the table. 

3. Set the table widget's **onPageChange** event to run the query.

4. To provide the user with information about the number of records in the table, you can configure the **Total records** property to be displayed in the table header. Create a new Query, and add:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

You can use `{{fetch_users_count.data[0].count}}` COUNT query to display the count. Additionally, you can use the total record count to enable or disable the next/previous controls. 

<figure>
  <img src="/img/off-set.gif" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Display images on table row selection"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Offset-based pagination</i></figcaption>
</figure>

  </TabItem>
  

  <TabItem value="Cursor" label="Cursor-based-pagination">

Instead of using page numbers and sizes, cursor-based pagination uses a cursor, which is a unique identifier that points to a specific item in the dataset.

1. Fetch data from the sample **users** database using `previousPageVisited` and `nextPageVisited` reference properties to implement pagination.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users {{Table1.nextPageVisited ?  "WHERE id > "+ " "+ Table1.tableData[Table1.tableData.length-1]["id"] : Table1.previousPageVisited ? "WHERE id <"+ " "+ Table1.tableData[0]["id"] : "" }} ORDER BY id LIMIT {{Table1.pageSize}} ;
   ```
This SQL query selects all columns from the `users` table and applies cursor-based pagination to limit the number of results returned. The `WHERE` clause is dynamically generated based on whether the user has already visited the `next` or `previous` page, and orders the results by `ID`.

2. Enable the **Server-side pagination** property in the table. 

3. Set the table widget's **onPageChange** event to run the query.

4. To provide the user with information about the number of records in the table, you can configure the **Total records** property to be displayed in the table header. 

For example, you can use `{{fetch_users_count.data[0].count}}` COUNT query to display the count. Additionally, you can use the total record count to enable or disable the next/previous controls. 

<figure>
  <img src="/img/cursor.gif" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Display images on table row selection"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Cursor-based pagination</i></figcaption>
</figure>



  </TabItem>
 
</Tabs>



## Server-side searching

Server-side searching is a technique of searching for specific records from the server using search terms, without relying on the client-side. To enable the search bar in the table header for server-side searching, you can turn on the **Allow Searching** property. 

The `searchText` reference property can be used to filter records displayed in a table based on the user's search terms. When the user types into the search bar, the `onSearchTextChange` event of the table is triggered, which can be configured to query the table's datasource for the matching results. 

To use the server-side search with the Table widget, follow these steps:

1. Create a SQL query using the `searchText` reference property:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE {{"%" + Table1.searchText + "%"}} ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
   ```

   You can also pass the `searchText` property as a URL parameter in an API request:
   ```
   https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?name={{Table1.searchText}}
   ```

2. Set the table widget's **onSearchTextChange** event to run the query. 

Watch this video to learn how to set up [server-side search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ayioaw5uj8) for the Table widget.


## Server-side filtering

Server-side filtering involves using a value to narrow down the results of a query in a similar way to server-side searching. However, instead of searching for a specific term, the selected value is used to filter out unwanted data from the requested dataset. 

To enable server-side filtering, you can use widgets such as the [Select widget](/reference/widgets/select/) to provide users with a list of supported filters to choose from.

1. Drag a Select widget to the canvas and add options that you might use to filter your data.

2. Create a query, and add the Select widget's `selectedOptionValue`:

    As a SQL query:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = {{genderDropdown.selectedOptionValue}};
    ```

    As an API request with URL parameters:
    ```
    https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?gender={{genderDropdown.selectedOptionValue}}
    ```

3. Set the Select widget's **onOptionChange** event to run the query. 


## Refresh table data

When changes are made to the datasource that supplies your table with data, the table won't automatically reflect these changes. Therefore, it is necessary to use events and/or write code that re-executes the query responsible for populating data into the table whenever new data is submitted to the datasource.

**Example:**
For instance, suppose you have a table that receives its data from a query called `getData`, and you have a button that submits a form with new user input through a query called `sendNewData`.

1. When the form is submitted via the button's `onClick`, it executes
    ```javascript
    {{ sendNewData.run() }}
    ```
2. On success, it executes `getData.run()` as a callback to get the latest version of the dataset that includes the new changes:
    ```javascript
    {{ sendNewData.run(() => getData.run(), () => {}) }}
    ```

Now when `sendNewData` succeeds, your table automatically refreshes itself.
