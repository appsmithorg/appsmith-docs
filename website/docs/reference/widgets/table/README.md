# Table

This page explains how to use a Table widget to display data in tabular format, trigger actions based on user interaction, and work with paginated data sets of any size.

<VideoEmbed host="youtube" videoId="-rzePEV2QQ8" title="Using the Table Widget" caption="Using the Table Widget"/>

## Display data 

To display data in a Table widget, you can use the **Table Data** property.

 The data should be specified as an array of objects, where each object in the array represents a row, and the properties of the object represent the columns in the table. In the given example format, the table has three columns: `step`, `task`, and `status`. 

```js
[
  {
    "step": "#1",
    "task": "Drop a table",
    "status": "approved"
  },
  {
    "step": "#2",
    "task": "Create a query fetch_users with the Mock DB",
    "status": "pending"
  },
  {
    "step": "#3",
    "task": "Bind the query using => fetch_users.data",
    "status": "pending"
  }
]
```

You can dynamically generate table by fetching data from queries or JS functions by binding the response to the **Table Data** property.

---
**Example 1:** suppose you have data stored in a database and you want to display it in the Table widget.

1.  Fetch data from the [sample database](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases#sample-databases) `users` using a SELECT query `fetchData` to retrieve the data.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
```

2. In the Table's **Table Data** property, display the data using:

```js
{{fetchData.data}}
```

---
**Example 2:** if the data retrieved from the query is not in the desired format, you can use JavaScript to transform it before passing it to the Table widget.

1.  Fetch data from the [sample API](/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication#sample-api) `users` using the following URL:

```
https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?page=1
```


2. Use JavaScript to transform the data by adding it to the **Table Data** property.

```javascript
{{fetchApi.data.users.map((user) => {
  return {
    name: user.name,
    email: user.email
    };
  });
}}
```

This code is using the `map()` function to extract specific data, such as the `name`,and `email`, from the `fetchApi` query. 


## Server-side pagination

Appsmith can handle query responses of up to 5 MB. To display large datasets and optimise performance, use server-side pagination. It can be implemented using Offset-based pagination or Cursor-based pagination:

<Tabs queryString="current-edition">
<TabItem label="Offset-based pagination" value="Offset_edition">


 Offset-based pagination works by using the page number and size to calculate the offset of records to fetch from a database or API. 

1. Fetch data from the [sample database](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases#sample-databases) `users` using `pageSize` and `pageOffset`  reference properties to implement pagination.

   ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users LIMIT {{ Table1.pageSize }} OFFSET {{ Table1.pageOffset }}; 
   ```
 In an API query, the page number can be passed as a query parameter to retrieve the corresponding subset of data, as shown in the example URL:

   ```
   https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?page={{Table1.pageNo}}
   ```

2. Enable the **Server-side pagination** property in the table. 

3. Set the table widget's **onPageChange** event to run the query.

4. To provide the user with information about the number of records in the table, you can configure the **Total records** property to be displayed in the table header. Create a new Query, and add:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

You can use `{{fetch_users_count.data[0].count}}` COUNT query to display the count. Additionally, you can use the total record count to enable or disable the next/previous controls.

  <img src="/img/off-set.gif" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Display images on table row selection"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Offset-based pagination</i></figcaption>
</figure>

  </TabItem>
  

  <TabItem value="Cursor" label="Cursor-based pagination">

Instead of using page numbers and sizes, cursor-based pagination uses a cursor, which is a unique identifier that points to a specific item in the dataset.

1. Fetch data from the [sample database](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connecting-to-databases#sample-databases) `users` using `previousPageVisited` and `nextPageVisited` reference properties to implement pagination.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users {{Table1.nextPageVisited ?  "WHERE id > "+ " "+ Table1.tableData[Table1.tableData.length-1]["id"] : Table1.previousPageVisited ? "WHERE id <"+ " "+ Table1.tableData[0]["id"] : "" }} ORDER BY id LIMIT {{Table1.pageSize}} ;
   ```
This SQL query selects all columns from the `users` table and applies cursor-based pagination to limit the number of results returned. The `WHERE` clause is dynamically generated based on whether the user has already visited the `next` or `previous` page, and orders the results by `ID`.

2. Enable the **Server-side pagination** property in the table. 

3. Set the table widget's **onPageChange** event to run the query.

4. To provide the user with information about the number of records in the table, you can configure the **Total records** property to be displayed in the table header. 

For example, you can use `{{fetch_users_count.data[0].count}}` COUNT query to display the count. Additionally, you can use the total record count to enable or disable the next/previous controls. 

<figure>
  <img src="/img/cursor.gif" style= {{width:"700px", height:"auto"}} alt="Display images on table row selection"/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Cursor-based pagination</i></figcaption>
</figure>



  </TabItem>
 
</Tabs>


## Server-side searching

Server-side searching is a technique of searching for specific records from the server using search terms, without relying on the client-side. To enable the search bar in the table header for server-side searching, you can turn on the **Allow Searching** property. 

The `searchText` reference property can be used to filter records displayed in a table based on the user's search terms. When the user types into the search bar, the `onSearchTextChange` event of the table is triggered, which can be configured to query the table's datasource for the matching results. 

To use the server-side search with the Table widget, follow these steps:

1. Create a SQL query using the `searchText` reference property:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE {{"%" + Table1.searchText + "%"}} ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
   ```

   You can also pass the `searchText` property as a URL parameter in an API request:
   ```
   https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?name={{Table1.searchText}}
   ```

2. Set the table widget's **onSearchTextChange** event to run the query. 

Watch this video to learn how to set up [server-side search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ayioaw5uj8) for the Table widget.

## Server-side filtering

Server-side filtering involves using a value to narrow down the results of a query in a similar way to server-side searching. However, instead of searching for a specific term, the selected value is used to filter out unwanted data from the requested dataset. 

To enable server-side filtering, you can use widgets such as the [Select widget](/reference/widgets/select/) to provide users with a list of supported filters to choose from.

1. Drag a Select widget to the canvas and add options that you might use to filter your data.

2. Create a query, and add the Select widget's `selectedOptionValue`:

    As a SQL query:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = {{genderDropdown.selectedOptionValue}};
    ```

    As an API request with URL parameters:
    ```
    https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?gender={{genderDropdown.selectedOptionValue}}
    ```

3. Set the Select widget's **onOptionChange** event to run the query. 

## Edit table data

To edit and update table data directly from the UI, you can use Inline editing. To enable inline editing for a table, you can make individual columns editable by checking the **Editable** checkbox in the Columns section of the Table widget properties panel. Once inline editing is enabled, you can double-click on a cell to edit its contents.

Learn more about [Inline editing](/reference/widgets/table/inline-editing).


## Refresh table data

When changes are made to the datasource that supplies your table with data, the table won't automatically reflect these changes. Therefore, it is necessary to use events and/or write code that re-executes the query responsible for populating data into the table whenever new data is submitted to the datasource.

**Example:**
For instance, suppose you have a table that receives its data from a query called `getData`, and you have a button that submits a form with new user input through a query called `sendNewData`.

1. When the form is submitted via the button's `onClick`, it executes
    ```javascript
    {{ sendNewData.run() }}
    ```
2. On success, it executes `getData.run()` as a callback to get the latest version of the dataset that includes the new changes:
    ```javascript
    {{ sendNewData.run(() => getData.run(), () => {}) }}
    ```

Now when `sendNewData` succeeds, your table automatically refreshes itself.




## Properties

Properties allow you to edit the widget, connect it with other widgets and customize the user actions.


### Widget properties

These properties allow you to edit the widget. All of these properties are present in the property pane of the widget.

### Events

When the event is triggered, these event handlers can run queries, JS code, or other supported [actions.](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions)

| Action                 | Description               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **onRowSelected**      | Sets the action to run when the user selects a row.   |
| **onPageChange**       | Sets the action to run when the table's page changes.  |
| **onPageSizeChange**   | Sets the action to run when the table's height is changed. This event can only be triggered by developers working on the app, not by end users. For example, it can be used to set a Limit in your query dynamically. |
| **onSearchTextChange** | Sets the action to run when the user enters a search text.     |
| **onSort**             | Sets the action to run when the user sorts the data.          |
