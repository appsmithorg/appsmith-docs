### Label

The property hosts a group of configurations that you can use to associate a display name and define a placement for the widget. These properties are usually useful when you want to design forms that follow a defined alignment for your form fields and give a professional look to your forms. Below are the properties that you can use:

#### **Text**

It allows you to set the display name for the Checkbox Group. For example, if you want the user to give their consent to the terms & conditions, you can enter the text as "Terms & Conditions."

:::tip
You can leave the text empty if you don't want any display name for your Checkbox Group widget.
:::

#### Position

It allows you to specify the placement of the label. You can select one of the available options:

* Top - It allows you to align the text at the top of the Checkbox Group.
* Left - It aligns the text to the left of the Checkbox Group. When you select **Left** alignment, you get additional settings that you can use to control the alignment and define the text's width.
  * Alignment - With the help of alignment, you can define the placement of the text in accordance with the position of the Checkbox Group. You can choose:
    * Left - It aligns the text to the widget's left boundary that is away from the Checkbox Group.
    * Right - It aligns the text closer to the Checkbox Group.
  * Width - With the help of width, you can define the **number of columns** in the **grid** that surrounds the widget. You can specify how close or far the text can be placed to the Checkbox Group.
* Auto - It automatically adjusts the position of the text based on the Checkbox Group's height.

:::info
Columns are the dashed lines (-----) that surround a widget when you try to drag and drop it on the canvas.
