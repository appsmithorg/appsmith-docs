### General properties

General properties control the data and behavior of the Input widget. These properties are present in the widget's properties pane.

| Widget Property     | Description       |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Data Type**       | Sets the type of data you want to capture in the user input. Selecting a data type adds the associated validation to the user input. Choose from Single-line text, Multi-line text, Number, Password, or Email.       |
| **Default text**    | Sets the widget's default value before the user has made any changes.       |
| **Max Chars**       | Sets a maximum length allowed for user input. Only appears when **Data Type** is set to Text.    |
| **Min**             | Sets a minimum value allowed for user input. Only appears when **Data Type** is set to Number.       |
| **Max**             | Sets a maximum value allowed for user input. Only appears when **Data Type** is set to Number.      |
| **Regex**           | Used to add custom regex validation to perform on user input. When the input doesn't match the regex expression, the input is considered invalid.                                                     |
| **Valid**           | Sets an expression to decide whether the user's input is considered valid. When the expression evaluates to `false`, the input is considered invalid and the widget shows its **Error Message**.   |
| **Error message**   | Sets the text of the error message to display if user input is considered invalid.      |
| **Placeholder**     | Sets the placeholder text within the input box. Use to show a hint or example value to the user.    |
| **Tooltip**         | Sets a tooltip for the widget. You can add hints or extra information about the required input from the user.    |
| **Show step arrows**  | Controls visibility of step arrows. Turning this toggle off hides the step arrows to increment or decrement the values in the widget.                                                                        |
| **Required**        | Sets whether the input field is a mandatory field. When the input widget is within a Form widget, that Form's submit button automatically disables until a user adds input to the field.       |
| **Visible**         | Controls widget's visibility on the page. When turned off: The widget isn't visible when the app is published. It appears translucent when in Edit mode.     |
| **Disabled**        | Makes the widget un-clickable or unusable. The widget remains visible to the user, but user interaction isn't allowed.     |
| **Reset on Submit** | Clears the value entered by the user after form submission.       |
| **Autofocus**       | When enabled, the user's cursor focuses on the input box automatically on page load.      |
| **Animate Loading** | When turned off, the widget loads without any skeletal animation. You can use a toggle switch to turn it on/off. You can also turn it off/on using javascript by enabling the JS label next to it. |
| **Spellcheck**      | When enabled, user input is checked for spelling errors.    |
| [**Height**](/reference/widgets/#height)  | It configures how a widgetâ€™s height reacts to content changes. It has three possible configurations:<br/>**Fixed**: The height of the widget remains as set using drag and resize.<br/>**Auto Height**: The height of the widget reacts to content changes.<br/>  **Auto Height with limits**: Same as Auto height, with a configurable option to set the minimum and maximum number of rows that can be occupied by the widget.                                      |
