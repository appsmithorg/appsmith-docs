## Content properties

These properties are customizable options present in the property pane of the widget, allowing users to modify the widget according to their preferences.


### Data

#### Tabs `string`

<dd>

Allows you to manage tabs within the widget, where each tab is identified by a unique name. You can rearrange the tabs items and configure their visibility by clicking on the gear icon ⚙️.

</dd>

#### Default Tab `string`	


<dd>

Allows you to specify a default tab by its name, which is automatically displayed when the widget loads. Make sure the Tab name is exactly as specified. 

</dd>

### General

####

#### Visible `boolean`

<dd>

Controls the visibility of the widget. If you turn off this property, the widget would not be visible in View Mode. Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on **JS** next to the **Visible** property to conditionally control the widget's visibility. The default value for the property is `true`.

For example, if you want to make the widget visible only when the user selects "Yes" from a Select widget, you can use the following JavaScript expression: 
```js
{{Select1.selectedOptionValue === "Yes"}}
```



</dd>

#### Animate Loading `boolean`


<dd>

This property controls whether the widget is displayed with a loading animation. When enabled, the widget shows a skeletal animation during the loading process. Additionally, you can control it through JavaScript by clicking on the <code>JS</code> next to the property. The default value for the property is `true`.

</dd>


#### Show tabs `boolean`


<dd>

This option enables you to toggle the visibility of tabs. The default value for the property is `true`.

</dd>

#### Height `string`


<dd>

This property determines how the widget's height adjusts to changes in its content. There are three available options:


* **Fixed**: Maintains a constant height for the widget, allowing you to adjust it by dragging or using the resize handle.
* **Auto Height**: The widget's height adjusts dynamically in response to changes in its content.
* **Auto Height with limits**: Same as **Auto height**, with a configurable option to set the minimum and maximum number of rows the widget can occupy.

</dd>

#### Background Color `string`

Contains the name of the tab currently selected.

*Example:*

```js
{{Tabs1.selectedTab}}

## Methods

Widget property setters enable you to modify the values of widget properties at runtime, eliminating the need to manually update properties in the editor.

These methods are asynchronous and return a [Promise](/core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-promises#using-promises-in-appsmith). You can use the .then() block to ensure execution and sequencing of subsequent lines of code in Appsmith.


#### setVisibility (param: boolean): Promise

<dd>

Sets the visibility of the widget.

*Example*:

```js
Tabs1.setVisibility(true)
```

</dd>
