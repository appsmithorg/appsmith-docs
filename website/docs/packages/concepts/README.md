A package is a collection of JS, query and UI modules that can be versioned and distributed across applications. Inside packages, you can create multiple queries and JS modules, allowing you to bundle and organize your application logic efficiently. This modular approach supports the independent creation, updating, and distribution of specific modules, contributing to enhanced code reusability and maintainability.

Within a package, there are three types of Modules:

* **Query Modules:** Allows you to reuse database queries across different applications in the same workspace. They support dynamic parameters, facilitating adaptable data retrieval without modifying the overall query configuration.
* **JS Modules:** JavaScript Modules in Appsmith are reusable objects for JavaScript functions and objects. They promote code reusability and a standardized approach to data manipulation.
* **UI Modules:** UI Modules provide the capability to encapsulate widgets and other UI components, promoting reusability in the user interface. (Coming Soon)


## Key features

Appsmith Modules provide unique features that enhance the app-building capabilities of Appsmith, simplifying the process of designing and developing reusable applications.



### Dynamic parameters in query modules

Query modules provide a dynamic query configuration feature, allowing you to customize query parameters based on specific application requirements and user interactions. This feature enables the adaptation of queries to varying contexts within different applications.


### Create queries within JS Modules

The integration of entity references within JS modules provides developers with the capability to create and manage private entities such as JS objects and queries. These entities, created within JS modules, can be referenced and manipulated using the Appsmith global object and functions, ensuring a seamless connection between the module and the application's main JS code.

* Modules can reference global objects and functions such as store, user, and navigate.
* Use the store object for efficient data storage and retrieval within the module.

Versioning is a critical aspect of the modular system, offering enterprises the flexibility to manage updates selectively. By integrating with Git, the system allows developers to connect packages to their Git repositories. This enables the tagging of specific commits in Git, and only those tagged versions are promoted to the application.

* **Git Integration:** Connect packages to Git repositories to leverage version control features.
* **Commit Tagging:** Tag specific commits in Git to mark versions for promotion.
* **Selective Consumption:** Application developers can choose which version (tag) of a package they want to import.
* **Enterprise Control:** Enterprises can strategically manage updates to minimize disruptions and ensure stability.

### Versions

When you update and publish a package, these modifications automatically apply in the edit mode of the app. However, the live (deployed) version of the app remains unchanged until you redeploy the app. For instance, updating a query module in a package won't affect the deployed version until the application is redeployed.



### Package import/export

This feature allows you to seamlessly import and export packages across different workspaces, similar to how apps are handled. When exporting a package, it is saved as a JSON file, and you can import it into another workspace or application as needed. When importing a package, you can upload the file into your workspace, and Appsmith automatically recognizes and categorizes it as a package or an app.

### Conclusion

Modules in Appsmith offer a comprehensive solution for streamlined and reusable application development. From encapsulating queries and functions to versioning and import/export, Appsmith's package functionality contributes to a robust and flexible app-building experience.
