Reusability is a pivotal aspect of application development, offering benefits such as accelerated development, centralized business logic, and the introduction of standardization into applications.

## Modules in Appsmith

Modules in Appsmith are powerful abstractions that facilitate the reuse and organization of code, promoting scalability and maintainability in application development.

* ***Reusability***: Modules allow developers to create a shared library of reusable components, widgets, and queries that can be used across multiple applications.

* **Consistent Updates**: Any modification made to a module is immediately reflected in every application where the module is used, ensuring consistency and easy maintenance.

* **Composability**: Modules enable bidirectional communication between the parent app and the module through data inputs and query inputs, enhancing composability.

* **Organizational Efficiency**: Modules focus on keeping apps and building blocks organized, making it easier to update, faster to build, and less prone to debugging issues.

### Query Modules

Query Modules in Appsmith are specialized modules designed to encapsulate and reuse database queries across multiple applications within the same workspace. 

When working with queries, there might be scenarios where you need to change query parameters dynamically. Query Modules facilitate this by providing `inputs` that can be linked to widgets or app-level parameters. These inputs act as dynamic variables, enabling developers to modify query parameters based on user interactions or changing application requirements. 

#### Key Features

* **Cross-Application Reusability:** Query Modules enable developers to rescue queries seamlessly across multiple applications within the same workspace, fostering a consistent and standardized approach to data retrieval.

* **Workspace-Level Efficiency:** With the ability to reuse queries at the workspace level, Query Modules contribute to enhanced efficiency and centralized management of database queries. Developers can make updates or modifications in one central location

* Enhanced Maintenance: Any updates or modifications made to a Query Module are instantly reflected in all the applications where the module is utilized, ensuring a streamlined maintenance process.


#### Limitation

* **Binding Constraints:** It's important to note that Query Modules have certain limitations, such as the inability to bind JS Module or JSObject data directly inside these modules. 


### JavaScript Modules

JavaScript Modules in Appsmith are reusable JavaScript objects that can be shared across different applications within the same workspace. These modules empower developers to encapsulate and reuse JavaScript functions and objects, promoting code reusability and a standardized approach to data manipulation.
