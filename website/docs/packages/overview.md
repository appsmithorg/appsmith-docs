# Overview

Reusability is an integral part of application development, offering various advantages like speeding up the development process, centralizing business logic, and introducing standardization into applications.

## Reusability Features

The introduction of Blocks, Modules, and Packages aligns with the diverse needs of developers, community members, and businesses, promoting efficiency and collaboration in application development.


### Community Edition - Blocks

Blocks are reusable components in Appsmith, consisting of **widgets**, **queries**, and/or **JavaScript** bundled into a single **JSON** document. This exportable format allows developers to effortlessly capture and reuse their work across various applications. 

Importable into any instance, Blocks offer a straightforward means for developers to share their work efficiently. This feature proves particularly beneficial for developers looking to avoid the tedious task of copying code across different pages and applications.

* Feature: Blocks
* Description: Collection of components bundled into a JSON document for easy export and reuse.
* Benefits: Fast and portable reusability.

### Business Edition - Modules

A **Package** is a collection of Modules designed for enterprise users in Appsmith. **Modules** are reusable components containing sets of queries and JavaScript objects that can yield results across multiple applications within the same workspace.

While Blocks serve as templates for reusable work, Modules extend this functionality by enabling users to track and manage updates across all subscribing applications. This feature proves advantageous for organizations seeking standardization, allowing them to enforce consistency in reusable work.
