# Create Reusable Query Modules

Reusable query modules typically refer to components or sections of code that encapsulate a specific query or set of queries, designed to be easily reused in different parts of application.

With modules, you can create consistent search filters, develop universally applicable navigation bars, share forms between various apps, and lot more.
