# Overview

Appsmith offers plug-and-play support for many datasources and the RESTful API plugin for seamless integration with other third-party tools.

Appsmith encrypts all your datasource credentials and stores them securely. Appsmith also doesn't store any data returned from your datasources and acts only as a proxy layer to orchestrate the execution of Queries. As Appsmith is an open source framework, you can [deploy it on-premise](/getting-started/setup), and audit it to ensure none of your data leaves your VPC. For more information, see [Security](/product/security#security-measures-within-appsmith).
