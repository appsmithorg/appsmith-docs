# Overview

Datasources are used to connect to your external databases & APIs. Appsmith can connect to a variety of [Datasources](/connect-data/reference) and any REST API. Queries can be created on top of datasources to read and write data from them. Queries interact with widgets via javascript to display and capture data.

## Security

Appsmith encrypts all your datasource credentials and stores them securely. Appsmith doesn't store any data returned from your datasources and acts only as a proxy layer to orchestrate the execution of queries. Read about the [Security Measures](/product/security#security-measures-within-appsmith).

## Get started

1. [Find your datasource](/connect-data/reference) and connect to it.
   - Learn how to identify and connect your data source to Appsmith to get started with building apps.

2. Learn about [parameterising queries](/connect-data/concepts/dynamic-queries).
   - Discover how to use dynamic queries by adding parameters to make your app more flexible and interactive.

3. Start [app building](/build-apps/overview).
   - Begin building applications by using connected data sources and designing interactive workflows.
