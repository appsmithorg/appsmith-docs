# Connection Pooling in Appsmith

Connection pooling is particularly important when developing applications that require frequent interactions with a database. Keeping unnecessary connections open can be resource-intensive and may lead to performance degradation, which is why connection pooling plays a crucial role.

## How connection pooling works in Appsmith

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of how Appsmith manages connection pooling:

1. **Initialization**: When an Appsmith application starts, it initializes the pool by creating a number of database connections up to a configured minimum.

2. **Connection Request**: When a database query is triggered from a widget or an API call, Appsmith first checks the pool for an available connection.

3. **Connection Allocation**: If an idle connection is available in the pool, it allocates that connection to the current request.

4. **Connection Release**: Once the query execution is complete, instead of closing the database connection, Appsmith releases it back to the connection pool, marking it as available for future use.

5. **Connection Creation**: If no idle connections are available and the pool has not reached its maximum size, Appsmith may create a new connection and add it to the pool.

6. **Connection Limiting**: Pooling ensures that the number of open connections does not exceed a certain limit, as defined by the maximum configuration of the pool.

7. **Connection Closing**: Connections that are idle for an extended period or have become invalid due to network issues or database restarts are closed and removed from the pool.

## Benefits of connection pooling in Appsmith

- **Improved Performance**: Connection pools reduce the overhead associated with establishing and closing connections, leading to faster response times.

- **Resource Optimization**: It ensures efficient use of database connections which helps in minimizing the resource usage on both the application and database server.

- **Scalability**: With connection pooling, Appsmith applications can handle increased load by reusing connections, thereby supporting more concurrent users.

- **Resilience**: Connection pools often have mechanisms to automatically handle failed connections, thus improving the robustness of the application.

By default, Appsmith provides a pool limit of 5 that works well for standard use cases. However, developers can tweak these parameters in the _Admin Settings_ of their instance.

Connection pooling is a fundamental aspect of Appsmith's backend infrastructure, critical for developers building scalable and efficient applications. It ensures that database operations are handled gracefully, providing a better user experience and making the best use of available resources.
