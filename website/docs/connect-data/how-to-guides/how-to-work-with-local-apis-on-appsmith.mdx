# Connect to Local Datasource

This page describes how to connect a database or API that is hosted locally on the same machine as your Appsmith instance.

- **Datasource on localhost**: There are two methods:
  - ngrok(*Recommended*): To connect to a local datasource on a self-hosted _or_ an Appsmith cloud instance, expose the datasource via **ngrok**. For directions, see [ngrok](/connect-data/how-to-guides/how-to-work-with-local-apis-on-appsmith?connect-method=ngrok).
  - host.docker.internal: This method is only for self-hosted users for connecting from the Docker container to a datasource on localhost. This is for development purposes and does not work in a production environment outside of Docker Desktop. For directions, see [host.docker.internal](/connect-data/how-to-guides/how-to-work-with-local-apis-on-appsmith?connect-method=localhost).

- **Datasource in Docker container**: This guide is only for self-hosted users for connecting to a datasource in a Docker container. For directions, see [Datasource in Docker](/connect-data/how-to-guides/how-to-work-with-local-apis-on-appsmith?connect-method=localhost#datasource-in-docker-container)

<TabItem label="ngrok(Recommended)" value="ngrok">

With ngrok, you can expose your local datasource to the internet and connect from the cloud:

**Set up ngrok:** first, you'll need to [sign up for an account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) with ngrok if you don't have one already. Then, follow the [setup instructions](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to install and configure ngrok for the first time. Run `ngrok help` to make sure it's ready to work.

Once you are ready to work with ngrok, follow these steps to connect Appsmith to your database:

1. Expose your database or API with the ```ngrok``` command:
  ```bash
  ngrok <protocol> <port>
  ```

2. When the command completes, ngrok returns you a set of session details including the **Forwarding** address.

3. Back in your Appsmith app, [create a datasource](/getting-started/tutorials/start-building#connect-to-a-database) for the appropriate type of database or API.

4. Enter the URL or **Host Address** & **Port** that you just got from ngrok, then configure your remaining datasource details as normal. If you used the `http` protocol, no port is necessary.

5. Click **Test** to verify that the connection is valid.

Your localhost application should now be connected and query-able from within your Appsmith app.

This guide describes how to connect your self-hosted Appsmith instance to your localhost datasource. These steps won't work if you're connecting from the Appsmith Cloud platform.

To connect to your database on localhost:

1. Ensure that all of the relevant Docker containers are running. If you are running on Linux, [see the note below](#linux-note) before starting. 

2. In your Appsmith app, create a [datasource](/connect-data/reference) for the appropriate type of database or API.

3. In the **Host Address** or URL field where you'd normally provide the URL for your datasource, instead enter `host.docker.internal`.

4. Click **Test** to verify that the connection is valid.

Your localhost application should now be connected and query-able from within your Appsmith app.

:::caution note
**Linux**: If your containers are running on a Linux machine, start your Appsmith container with the following command line argument to `docker run`. This is only supported for Docker 20.10.0 and later.

```bash
--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway
```

Or, for `docker-compose`, update your docker-compose.yaml file to include the following `extra_hosts` option:

```yml
services: ...
  postgres: ...
    environment: ...
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

## Datasource in Docker container

This guide describes how to connect your APIs and databases to your Appsmith instance when they are each in separate Docker containers.

#### Set up services

In this guide, you'll use networked Docker containers to spin up a Postgres instance alongside Appsmith and connect to the database from an Appsmith app. These steps won't work if you're connecting from the Appsmith Cloud platform.

1. From the command line, create a Docker network with the following:

    ```bash
    docker network create appsmithnetwork
    ```

1. Create two folders, `Appsmith` and `Datasource`.

1. Within the `Appsmith` folder, create a `docker-compose.yml` file for Appsmith. Assign it to the network from the first step, such as in the bottom of this example file:

    ```yaml
    version: "3"
    services:
        appsmith:
            # appsmith-ce for community edition, appsmith-ee for business.
            image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
            container_name: appsmith
            ports:
                - "80:80"
                - "443:443"
            volumes:
                - ./stacks:/appsmith-stacks
            restart: unless-stopped
            networks:
                - appsmithnetwork
    networks:
    appsmithnetwork:
        external: true
    ```

1. Start the Appsmith container with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

1. Inside the `DataSource` folder, create `docker-compose.yml` file and assign it to the same network from before.

1. Start the Datasource container with:
   
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

#### Connect to the database from Appsmith

Now, you are ready to open your app and connect to your Postgres instance.

1. In Appsmith, create a Postgres datasource.

1. For the **Host Address** field, enter the name of the Docker container that's running your Postgres instance. For example, this might look something like `postgres_postgres_1`.

    :::tip
    If you need to see the names of the containers running on your network, you can use the command:

    ```bash
    docker network inspect <network_name>
    ```
    :::

1. Fill in the remaining fields for your database and try the **Test** button. Your database should now be connected.
