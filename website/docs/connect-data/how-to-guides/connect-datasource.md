# Connect Datasource

This page shows you how to connect to a datasource on Appsmith.

1. Click the **Explorer** tab on the entity explorer to the screen's left. 

2. Click the **+** icon next toÂ **Datasources**.

3. From the list, select the datasource you need to connect to. This opens the page where you can configure the parameters to connect to your datasource.

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>List of Datasources</i></figcaption>
</figure>

4. Rename the datasource to be able to identify it when creating queries.

5. If you are a self-hosted user, you need to whitelist the IP addresses `18.223.74.85` and `3.131.104.27` of the Appsmith deployment on your datasource instance before connecting to it. 

6. Set the required connection parameters to connect to your datasource. If you are on [Business Edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing), you can configure production and staging datasources using [datasource environments](/connect-data/concepts/Datasource-Environments). Appsmith encrypts all your datasource credentials and stores them securely. For a complete description of the connection parameters, see the [Reference guide](/connect-data/reference) for your datasource. 

:::info
If your datasource is locally hosted, follow the instructions in [Connect Datasouce on Local Machine](/connect-data/how-to-guides/how-to-work-with-local-apis-on-appsmith) to get the hostname.

7. Click the **Test** button to test the connection and ensure the datasource is valid.

8. Click **Save** to create and save the datasource connection.
