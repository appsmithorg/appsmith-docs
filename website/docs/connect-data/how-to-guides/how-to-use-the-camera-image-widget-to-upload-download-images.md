# Upload Images to S3 Using Camera

This page provides steps to upload images using the Camera widget to the S3 datasource.

## Prerequisites
- An [Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) in one of the AWS Regions.
- App connected to an [S3 datasource](https://docs.appsmith.com/connect-data/reference/querying-amazon-s3).

## Set up upload query
To upload an image or a video to Amazon S3, follow these steps:
1. Drag and drop the [Camera widget](/reference/widgets/camera) onto the canvas.
2. In **Queries/JS**, click the **+ Add a new query/JS Object**.
3. Select your S3 datasource.
4. Select **Create a new file** from **Commands**.
5. In **Bucket Name**, enter the name of the Amazon S3 bucket.
6. In **File Path**, enter the path of the location you want to store the file.
   For example, `images/camera_uploads`.
   Appsmith automatically creates intermediate folders if they don't exist.
7. Select **Base64** from **File Data Type** to upload data from the camera widget.
8. In **Expiry Duration of Signed URL (Minutes)**, enter an expiration time for the signed URL. A signed URL has a maximum expiration date of one week.
9. In **Content**, add data manually by writing an object with a text and data property, or fetch data from the camera widget.
   For example:

     ```
     {
	    "data": "{{Camera1.imageDataURL}}"
     }
     ```
10. Once all the required parameters have been added, set the **OnImageCapture** event on the Camera widget's property pane to execute the S3 query.
    Query execution occurs when you capture and save an image.
    To see the uploaded media, visit the [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home).
