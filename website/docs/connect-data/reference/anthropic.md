<dd>

The maximum number of tokens the response should contain. It allows you to control the length of the generated output.

</dd>

#### Messages

<dd>

Messages serve as input interactions between the user and the model. You can create multiple messages of each type to make your conversation just the way you want. In the **Roles** parameter, you can select either `Human` or `Assistant`. In the **Content** property, add:

* **Assistant**: It serves as a means to provide additional context, set guidelines, or convey the overall objective of the task. It helps shape the behavior of the model's responses. For example, you can use the system message to give personality to the responses or add task-specific instructions. For example, you can set `Assistant` as:

<dd>


 "You are a technical support assistant. Provide clear and detailed solutions to user queries related to software issues. If the user mentions a bug, ask for additional details to troubleshoot effectively."

</dd>

* **Human**: Input provided by the user to instruct or guide the model. For example, if you are using an Input widget to enter the prompt, you can use `{{Input1.text}}`.

<dd>

#### Temperature

<dd>

 Temperature determines the level of randomness in the output. It ranges between 0 and 1. 

Lower values for temperature result in more focused and analytical outputs (e.g. 0.2), while higher values generate more diverse and creative results (e.g. 0.8). Select a temperature value based on the desired trade-off between coherence and creativity for your specific application.
