# S3

This page provides information for connecting your application to your Amazon S3 bucket and using queries to manage its content.

This datasource can also be used to connect to any S3-compatible object storage provider such as Upcloud, Digital Ocean Spaces, Wasabi, DreamObjects, and MinIO.

## Connect S3

:::caution
You must whitelist the IP address of the Appsmith deployment `18.223.74.85` and `3.131.104.27` on your S3 instance before connecting to the bucket. For more information about whitelisting on Amazon, see [Managing access based on specific IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-IP).

### List files in bucket

This command returns an array of objects representing items that are contained within the bucket, each including at least a `fileName` property. The following section lists all the fields available for the **List files in a bucket** command.


#### Bucket name

<dd>

The name of the S3 bucket to query.

</dd>

#### Prefix

<dd>

The directory path of the files you'd like to query.

For example, in `sample/path/example.png`, the **Prefix** is `sample/path`. Using the prefix `sample/path` with no filtering returns all files in the `sample/path` directory.

</dd>

#### Where

<dd>

These fields are used to create logic expressions that filter query results based on column values. Available comparison operators are `==`, `!=`, `in`, and `not in`.

</dd>

#### Generate signed URL

<dd>

Requests an authenticated, user-accessible URL for each file in the response. Users may follow the link in their browser to see the content of the file. The URL expires after the amount of time specified in **Expiry duration of signed URL**.

</dd>

#### Expiry duration of signed URL

<dd>

The length of time in minutes that the returned Signed URL is valid. Accepts number values up to `10080` minutes (7 days).

</dd>

#### Generate unsigned URL

<dd>

Requests the plain URL for each file in the query response. This URL does not expire, but it can't be used to access the resource directly, only via API.

</dd>

#### Sort by

<dd>

Orders the query results in ascending or descending order based on a given column's value.

</dd>

#### Pagination limit

<dd>

Limits the number of results that can be returned in a single response. Expects an integer.

</dd>

#### Pagination offset

<dd>

Skips a given number of files before returning the further results. Expects an integer.

</dd>
