## Query Google Calendar

The following section provides a reference guide describing available commands and their parameters for interacting with Google Calendar.

### Calendar Create Event

Creates a new event in a specified calendar. This command allows you to define event details such as name, time, location, and attendees, and returns the created event's details including its ID for future reference.

#### Event Name `string`
<dd>
This property specifies the name of the event. It is used as the event title visible in the calendar view and notifications.

The event name should be descriptive and concise to help users quickly identify the purpose of the meeting or event.

*Example*:
```
Quarterly Budget Review
```
</dd>

#### Start Time `string`
<dd>
The start time of the event. Accepts Unix timestamp or ISO 8601 date formats. This defines when the event begins.

To find the correct format:
* ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssÂ±hh:mm` (e.g., `2025-06-15T09:00:00-07:00`)
* Unix timestamp: Number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (e.g., `1750003200`)

*Example*:
```
2025-06-15T09:00:00-07:00
```
</dd>

#### End Time `string`
<dd>
The end time of the event. Accepts Unix timestamp or ISO 8601 date formats. If omitted, it defaults to one hour after the start time.

The end time must be after the start time, and for all-day events, should be set to the day after the start date.

*Example*:
```
2025-06-15T10:30:00-07:00
```
</dd>

#### Calendar `string`
<dd>

To locate the calendar ID:
* In Google Calendar web interface, go to Settings > [Calendar name] > Integrate calendar
* Look for the "Calendar ID" field, which typically looks like an email address

*Example*:
```
primary
```

For a secondary calendar:
```
user@example.com
```
</dd>

#### Attendees `string`
<dd>
An array of email addresses or a comma-separated list of email addresses representing event attendees. These users will receive calendar invitations for the event.

```

*Example for comma-separated list*:
```
john.doe@example.com, jane.smith@example.com
```
</dd>

#### Event Location `string`
<dd>
The location where the event will take place. This can be a physical address, room name, or virtual meeting location.

<dd>
An application-specific ID to associate with this event. This ID can be used to sync updates to the event later.

*Example*:
```
budget-review-q2-2025
```
</dd>

#### Include Meet Link `boolean`
<dd>
If set to true, automatically creates a Google Meet conference link for the event. This adds a video conferencing option that attendees can use to join the meeting.
