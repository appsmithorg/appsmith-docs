# Notion

This page provides information on how to connect Notion with Appsmith, which allows you to build interactive tools or dashboards that fetch, create, or update Notion content.

## Connect Notion

To connect Appsmith to Notion, start by authenticating with your Notion account using your Notion email.

Once authenticated, you'll be able to select a Notion workspace and choose specific databases or pages to work with. Appsmith allows you to interact with these resources through queries and actions, enabling seamless integration with your Notion data.

## Query Notion

The following section provides a reference guide describing available commands and their parameters for interacting with Notion.

### Create Page

Creates a new page in your Notion workspace. This command allows you to define page details such as parent location, properties, content blocks, and visual elements.

#### Parent `object`
<dd>
Specifies where the new page should be created in your Notion workspace. You can create the page either within an existing database or as a sub-page under another page.

To find a database ID:
* Open the database in Notion
* Look at the URL: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/[DATABASE_ID]?v=...`
* The ID is the part before the question mark, typically a 32-character string with hyphens

To find a page ID:
* Open the page in Notion
* Look at the URL: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/Page-Title-[PAGE_ID]`
* The ID is typically the last part of the URL, a 32-character string with hyphens

*Example for creating a page in a database*:
```js
{
  "database_id": "3f846c9a5d324a93a38a29b6c2a9cb12"
}
```

*Example for creating a sub-page under an existing page*:
```js
{
  "page_id": "7a774b5c39c942d4a640a9dc3a84f3f0"
}
```
</dd>

#### Properties `object`
<dd>
Defines values for the columns in a Notion database when creating a new page. This is required when the `parent` is a `database_id`.

Each key in the properties object should match a column name in the target Notion database, and the value should follow Notion's property format based on the column type.

Common property types include:
* Title: `{ "title": [{ "text": { "content": "Text here" } }] }`
* Select: `{ "select": { "name": "Option name" } }`
* Date: `{ "date": { "start": "2025-05-27" } }`
* Number: `{ "number": 42 }`
* Checkbox: `{ "checkbox": true }`

*Example for a task database with multiple properties*:
```js
{
  "Name": {
    "title": [
      {
        "text": {
          "content": "Quarterly Report"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "Status": {
    "select": {
      "name": "In Progress"
    }
  },
  "Due Date": {
    "date": {
      "start": "2025-06-15"
    }
  }
}
```
</dd>

#### Children `array`
<dd>
Defines the content blocks that appear inside the new Notion page. This is commonly used when creating a page under a `page_id` (not a database).

Each object in the array represents a block type like paragraph, heading, to-do, bulleted list, etc. Each block must specify its type and corresponding content.

Common block types include:
* Paragraph: `{ "type": "paragraph", "paragraph": { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Text here" } }] } }`
* Heading: `{ "type": "heading_2", "heading_2": { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Heading text" } }] } }`
* Bulleted list: `{ "type": "bulleted_list_item", "bulleted_list_item": { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "List item" } }] } }`

*Example for creating a page with multiple content blocks*:
```js
[
  {
    "object": "block",
    "type": "heading_2",
    "heading_2": {
      "rich_text": [
        {
          "text": {
            "content": "Project Overview"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "object": "block",
    "type": "paragraph",
    "paragraph": {
      "rich_text": [
        {
          "text": {
            "content": "This project aims to improve customer engagement through targeted content."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "object": "block",
    "type": "bulleted_list_item",
    "bulleted_list_item": {
      "rich_text": [
        {
          "text": {
            "content": "Phase 1: Research and planning"

        }
      ]
