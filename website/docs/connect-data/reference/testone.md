### Create Page

Creates a new page within a parent page or database in Notion.

#### Parent `JSON`

The Parent property defines the location where the new page will be created within Notion. It must be a JSON object containing either a `page_id` or `database_id` key with the corresponding ID. The ID should be in the format of a UUID.

- If omitted, the command will fail as the parent is required.
- You can find the `database_id` or `page_id` in the URL when you open the respective page or database in Notion.

*example*:
```json
{
  "database_id":"{{DATABASE_ID}}"
}
```

---

#### Properties `JSON`

- This field is required to create a page with properties.
- Omitting this field will result in a page with no properties set.

*example*:
```json
