# OAuth2 Authentication for Datasources

OAuth2 is a widely used authorization protocol that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on various services. This guide provides comprehensive information about implementing OAuth2 authentication for datasources in Appsmith.

## Understanding OAuth2 in Appsmith

OAuth2 authentication in Appsmith involves several key components:

- **Client ID**: A public identifier for your application
- **Client Secret**: A confidential key used to authenticate your application
- **Scopes**: Permissions that define what access levels your application requires
- **Authorization URL**: The endpoint where users grant permissions
- **Token URL**: The endpoint where access tokens are obtained
- **Refresh Token URL**: The endpoint for refreshing expired access tokens

## Common OAuth2 Flow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Obtain OAuth2 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) from the service provider
   - Configure the authorized redirect URIs in the provider's settings
   - Set up the required scopes based on your application's needs

2. **Authentication Process**
   - User initiates authentication through Appsmith
   - Appsmith redirects to the service provider's authorization page
   - User grants permissions
   - Service provider redirects back to Appsmith with an authorization code
   - Appsmith exchanges the code for access tokens

3. **Token Management**
   - Appsmith securely stores the access token
   - Automatically refreshes tokens when they expire
   - Handles token revocation when connections are removed

## Security Best Practices

1. **Credential Management**
   - Store OAuth2 credentials securely using environment variables
   - Never expose Client Secret in client-side code
   - Regularly rotate Client Secret if supported by the provider

2. **Scope Management**
   - Request minimum necessary permissions
   - Review and update scopes when application requirements change
   - Document required scopes for each integration

3. **Token Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all OAuth2 endpoints
   - Implement proper token storage and encryption
   - Handle token expiration gracefully

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
   - Ensure redirect URIs are properly configured
   - Check if required scopes are enabled

2. **Token Expiration**
   - Implement proper refresh token handling
   - Verify refresh token hasn't expired
   - Check if service provider's tokens are still valid

3. **Scope Issues**
   - Confirm all required scopes are requested
   - Verify user has granted necessary permissions
   - Check for scope changes in provider's API
