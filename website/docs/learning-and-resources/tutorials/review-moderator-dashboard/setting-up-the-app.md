# Setting up the App

If this is your first time using Appsmith, you'll need to get acquainted with some initial setup. When you log in, you'll be redirected to [Appsmith Dashboard](https://app.appsmith.com/applications). You'll see an auto-generated workspace called apps (your workspace). However, you can create multiple workspaces and organize your apps based on your preferences.

In this tutorial, you'll create a Review Moderator application under the same workspace. To do this, follow the below steps:

1. Click on the **Create New** under your workspace.
2. It will redirect to the configuration page of the newly created app.
3. You will see two options, **Build with drag & drop** or **Generate from the data table**.
4. For this tutorial, we will select **build with drag & drop**.
5. Note that the app will have a default name **Untitled Application 1.**
6. Rename it to **Review Moderator** by double-clicking on the existing one.

The new app comes with auto-generated directories that establish an Appsmith app. Below is a screenshot of the entity explorer.

Entity Explorer is where you can create and organize UI widgets, queries / JS objects, and data sources. You can also find different libraries under dependencies that you can utilize under these sections.

Now, let's rename the page from **Page1** to **Business Details**; you can do this by double-clicking on the existing name.

You have now set up the application. Next, let's jump into the next section. Here, you'll **connect to a data source and write your first DB Query on Appsmith!**
