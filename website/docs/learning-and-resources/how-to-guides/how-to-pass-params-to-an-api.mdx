# Pass Parameters to Queries in a Loop

This page describes how to use the run() function in a loop to pass different parameters to your query each time it runs.

In some cases, like running a query inside a loop, different parameters may need to be passed to the query each time with values contextual to the execution.

For this, you can use the [`run()` function's](/reference/appsmith-framework/query-object)  `params` argument to pass an object of key-value pairs into your query. You can access these values within the query using `{{ this.params.key }}`.

As an example, the snippets below fetch specific users from the mock **users** database based on their `id` value. Below, you'll see how to configure a query and a helper function to take an array of ids and run the query  in a loop for each of them.

1. To begin, you should have a query to which you'd like to pass contextual parameters.
1. Create a JS Object and rename it `utils`. This is where you write your helper function that calls the query and handles its responses.
1. Create a function that calls your query's [`run()` function](/reference/appsmith-framework/query-object) in a loop, using the `run()` function's first argument to pass your parameter. On completion, the results of the queries are mapped into an array and stored in the [Appsmith store](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions/store-value).

    ```javascript
    // Using promise syntax
    getByIds: async (ids) => {
        const queries = ids.map(id => {
            // highlight-start
            // each iteration of the loop will pass the next `id` from the `ids` array.
            return GetUserById.run({"id": id})
            // highlight-end
        })
        
        Promise.all(queries)
            // highlight-start
            // once the queries have settled, they results are stored in an array in the Appsmith store.
            .then(values => storeValue("results", values))
            // highlight-end
    }
    ```

1. In the query where you want to pass parameters, reference the params with `{{this.params.id}}`.

1. To execute the query loop, configure a trigger or widget action that calls your helper function in the JS Object:

    ```javascript
    {{ utils.getByIds([1, 4, 8, 34, 16]) }}
    ```

1. Wherever you want to use the results of the queries, you can reference the array containing those results from the Appsmith store like below:

    ```javascript
    {{ appsmith.store.results }}
    ```
