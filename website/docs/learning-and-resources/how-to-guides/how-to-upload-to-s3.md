## Uploading a File

To upload a file

1. Drag a [Filepicker widget](/reference/widgets/filepicker.md) onto the canvas.
1. Create a new S3 query named upload\_file to be run onFileSelected.
1. Select the [Create File Action](/reference/datasources/querying-amazon-s3.md#create-file) option for the query.
1. The action should be configured with the bucket name and relative path of the location you want to store the file. `ex. images/`any intermediate folders not existing are automatically created.
1. The name of the file should be configured in the file path field. This value can be picked from the Filepicker using JavaScript `images/{{ Filepicker1.files[0].name }}`
1. The content can be configured using the entire file object of the Filepicker. `{{Filepicker1.files[0]}}`
1. Select a file from the file picker and hit upload.

2. Create a new S3 query named **`fetch\_files`** to fetch all the files in your bucket.
   * Configure it with the [List Files](/reference/datasources/querying-amazon-s3.md#list-files) action.
   * Set the bucket name from where to fetch the files and run the query
   *   Bind the response of the query to the Table using JavaScript in the Table Data Property `{{fetch_files.data}}`.
