# Embed Apps

Tools and Dashboards are great as an app and on a website, and now, you can have it both in one go by embedding apps to your website. In this guide, you'll learn how to embed Appsmith Apps into any website.

### Creating HTML page

Firstly, lets create an HTML page and call it \``dashboard.html`\`. Now, add the basic HTML structure to make it an HTML page:

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title> Customer Dashboard </title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

You'll also have to ensure your app is public to embed into other applications. You can do this by clicking on the Share option on the top toolbar and toggle the viewing option to **Public**. Here's a video example:




<VideoEmbed host="youtube" videoId="gD0xV-Tt1_U" title="Follow these steps to make your application public" caption="Follow these steps to make your application public"/>

Next, create an `iframe` tag and add the shareable link from share options to the `src` attribute with height and width set to `500` and `100%` respectively.

Include the meta tag in the head to ensure that the embedded application renders responsively on different screen sizes:

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> 
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title> Customer Support Dashboard </title>
</head>
<body>
    <iframe src="<LINK_OF_APP>" height="700" width="100%"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```



### Opening the HTML page

:::info
If you are opening the HTML page as a`file,`then the browser won't allow you to do that. The HTML file needs to come from a server.
:::

After creating the HTML page, save it as `dashboard.html` and have an HTTP server serve it. This can be done in several ways:

#### Serving an HTML file with Node.js

Once you have created your HTML file, create a new `app.js`` `**``** file. Paste the below-mentioned code and edit your HTML filename.

```markup
const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'text/html' });
    const html = fs.readFileSync('./dashboard.html');
    res.end(html);
}).listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('running on 3000');
});
```

Now, in the terminal, run `node app.js`

This would prompt a `running on 3000` message. Next, go to your browser and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

This opens your HTML file.

#### Running npx http-server

Lets look at another way to open an HTML file.

Now, if you have _Node JS_ installed, go to the command terminal and run:

```
npx http-server
```

Next, open [http://localhost:8080/dashboard.html](http://localhost:8080/dashboard.html) and it should open the HTML File.

### Modifying layout

You can modify the layout of your embedded code directly from the settings of your Appsmith app. This allows you to control the appearance of your app when it's displayed on a website or another platform.

* To change the layout, open the `app settings`.
* Click on `Share & Embed`.
* Update the Embed size as desired.
* Copy the updated embed code.

If you want to get your app to use the whole page in your browser, you can change your height and width parameters like shown below:


```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
    <iframe src="<LINK_OF_APP>" scrolling="yes" seamless="seamless" style="display:block; width:100%; height:100vh;"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Remove Appsmith top bar

You can remove the Appsmith topbar with page tabs by appending **`?embed=true`** to the share URL. Alternatively, you can get this prepared URL from the `App Settings` on the canvas as shown below.

* Click on `App settings` in the Canvas properties .
* Click on `Share & Embed`.
* Toggle `Show navigation bar`.
* Copy the updated embed code.

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title> Customer Support Dashboard </title>
</head>
<body>
    <iframe src="<LINK_OF_APP>" height="700" width="100%"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```
