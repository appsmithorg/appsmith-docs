# Branding

Custom branding for Appsmith is a feature that allows users to customize the appearance of their Appsmith workspace and apps with their own logo and color palette. This allows users to create a more familiar and cohesive experience for their end-users, who will see a login screen, invite emails and error pages that match the branding of the user's company.

Branding is only available on self-hosted, [**Business Edition**](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing) instances of Appsmith.
