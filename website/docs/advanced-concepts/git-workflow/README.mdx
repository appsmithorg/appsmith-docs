# Git Workflow

Appsmith provides a way to version control your apps by connecting them to a Git hosting provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), making it easier to track changes, create rollbacks or collaborate using git branches.

:::info
In the Community edition, you can connect to **unlimited** public repositories but only up to **three** private repositories in a workspace. To connect more private repositories, you can upgrade to the [Business edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).

Version Control works with any Git hosting service that supports **SSH protocol** and **deploy keys**. HTTPS Git connections are currently not supported on Appsmith.


## Using Git in Appsmith

Version control in Appsmith is similar to the traditional Git workflow. The basic Git Workflow in Appsmith involves the following steps:

1. **Connect to Git repository:** Create a new repository and connect it to your Appsmith app.
2. **Setup a branch:** When you start working on a new feature or bug fix, you should create a new branch from the main branch. This ensures that your changes are isolated from the main branch until they are ready to be merged.
3. **Make changes in the app:** Once you have created a new branch, you can start making changes to the app. You can use the Appsmith editor to make changes to your application, and the changes will be automatically staged for commit.
4. **Commit changes:** After you have made changes to the app, you should commit and push the changes to your Git repository. This creates a snapshot of your changes and makes them available to other members of your team.
5. **Deploy changes:** To merge your changes with the main branch, create a pull request on your remote Git repository. Once your changes have been reviewed and approved, you can merge them with the main branch, integrating your changes with the rest of the application
6. **Revert changes:** If you need to revert changes that have already been committed to your Git repository, you can use the git revert command on the remote repository.
