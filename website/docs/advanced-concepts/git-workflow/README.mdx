# Git Workflow

Appsmith provides a way to version control your apps by connecting them to a Git hosting provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), making it easier to track changes, create rollbacks or collaborate using git branches.

:::info
In the Community edition, you can connect to **unlimited** public repositories but only up to **three** private repositories in a workspace. To connect more private repositories, you can upgrade to the [Business edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).

Version Control works with any Git hosting service that supports **SSH protocol** and **deploy keys**. HTTPS Git connections are currently not supported on Appsmith.


## Using Git in Appsmith

Version control in Appsmith is similar to the traditional Git workflow. The basic Git Workflow in Appsmith involves the following steps:

1. [Connect to Git repository](/advanced-concepts/git-workflow/connecting-to-git-repository)
2. [Setup branches](/advanced-concepts/git-workflow/working-with-branches)
4. [Commit changes](/advanced-concepts/git-workflow/commit-and-push)
5. [Deploy changes](/advanced-concepts/git-workflow/pull-and-sync)
6. [Revert changes](/advanced-concepts/git-workflow/revert-changes)
