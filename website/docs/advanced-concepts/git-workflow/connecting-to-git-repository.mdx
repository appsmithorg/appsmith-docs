# Connect To a Git Repository

The first step to using version control in Appsmith is to connect your remote repository with the app. Please follow the steps given below:

### Create a new repository

Create a new repository on your Git hosting service and copy the `SSH URL`. The repository shouldn't contain the any files.

### Generate a deploy key

1. Open the Appsmith app you want to connect to Git and click the **Connect Git** button on the left of the bottom bar.
2. In the Git connection modal, paste your repositoryâ€™s `SSH URL` and click the **Generate Key** button to generate an SSH key.

Appsmith supports two types of keys -  **ECDSA 256** and **RSA 4096**. Please pick the one that's compatible with your Git hosting service. 

## Add the deploy key in the Repository

Copy the **SSH key** generated in the preceding section. 

<Tabs queryString="current-edition">
<TabItem label="GitHub" value="github">

* In your repository, go to the **Settings** tab.
* On the navigation bar, under **Security**, click **Deploy Keys**. 
* Click **Add deploy key**. Add a title for the key and paste the generated `SSH key` in the **Key** input box.
* Select the **Allow write access** checkbox.
* Click **Add key**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GitLab" value="gitlab">

* Open the Settings> Repository and expand the deploy keys section.
* Click **Add key** Add the title and paste the generated key in the key section.
* Check the **Grant write permissions** to this key and add the key.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Bitbucket" value="bitbucket">

* Open **Personal Bitbucket settings** from the top right corner and under security go to **SSH keys**.
* Click **Add key**, add the label and paste the generated key in the **Key** input box.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Click **Connect**, it may take some time and when the connection is successful, the app is added to your repository by system generated commit.

## Updating local file path

For self-hosted instances, Appsmith clones the Git repositories in the local file system, attached to the persistent volume within the Docker container. To maintain the Git repositories, you need a file path that points to the volume within the Docker container.

To update the file path to point to a custom Git root where the repositories are persisted:

1.  Update the `APPSMITH_GIT_ROOT` environment variable as shown below:

```
APPSMITH_GIT_ROOT= <path-to-repo-directory>
```

2. Restart the container to apply changes.

:::info
If the file path isn't present, git repositories is cloned, but this isn't persistent, and Appsmith would try to clone the repositories in case they got deleted by docker restart, etc.
