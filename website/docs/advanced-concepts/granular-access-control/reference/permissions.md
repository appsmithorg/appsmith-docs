Permissions in Appsmith determine the level of access and actions users can take on specific resources within the platform. This page provides insights into the permissions available in Appsmith and their corresponding impact on resource access.

## Resources

Resources in Appsmith include pages, queries, datasources, environments, groups, roles, and workspaces. Access permissions are categorized as follows:


### Application Resources

This category governs access privileges to resources associated with workspaces and applications built in Appsmith, such as apps, pages or queries.

        caption="Permissions for Application Resources"
    />

#### Workspace

Below the workspace name, all the applications created in that workspace are displayed. Permissions assigned at the workspace level cascade down to all applications within it. To assign specific permissions to specific apps, see [Application](#application).

| Permission | Automatically assigns |  Cascades to resources |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Create | Edit, View, Delete, Execute | All apps, their pages, and queries |
| Edit | View, Execute | View - All apps and pages. View and Execute - queries   | 
| Delete |  View, Execute | View - All apps and pages. View and Execute - queries  | 
| View | Execute | View - All pages of all apps. Execute - all queries of all apps  | 
| Make Public |  View, Execute | View - All pages of all apps. Execute - all queries of all apps | 
| Export | View, Execute | View - All pages of all apps. Execute - all queries of all apps|

#### Application

Under the application name, all the resources created in that application are displayed. Permissions assigned at the application level cascade down to all resources within it. 

| Permission | Automatically assigns |  Cascades to resources |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Create | Edit, View, Delete, Execute | All pages and grants Execute permissions to queries |
| Edit | View, Execute | View - All pages. View and Execute - queries   | 
| Delete |  View, Execute | View - All pages. View and Execute - queries  | 
| View | Execute | View - All pages. Execute - queries of all apps  | 
| Make Public |  View, Execute | View - All pages. Execute - queries of all apps | 
| Export | View, Execute | View - All pages. Execute - queries of all apps|

You can assign specific permissions to pages and queries by selecting permissions for every page and query individually.

### Datasources and Environments

The datasources and environments display all the datasources available within the workspace and their corresponding environments. This category controls access to datasources and environments at the workspace level in Appsmith. You must assign individual permissions to both datasources and environments as they are not mutually exclusive. 

 <ZoomImage

        alt="Permissions for Datasources & Environments"
        caption="Permissions for Datasources & Environments"
    />

#### Datasources

These permissions control the access to datasources within a workspace, and are applicable to all datasources within that workspace. The permissions assigned to datasources do not cascade automatically to queries, and you must assign individual permissions to queries under the [Application Resources](#application-resources) tab. 

| Permission | Automatically assigns |  Cascades to resources |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Create | Edit, View, Delete, Execute | All datasources within the workspace |
| Edit | View, Execute | All datasources within the workspace   | 
| Delete |  View, Execute | All datasources within the workspace | 
| View | Execute | All datasources within the workspace  | 
| Execute |  - | All datasources within the workspace | 

#### Datasource

These permissions control access to a specific datasource within the workspace. 

| Permission | Automatically assigns |  Cascades to resources |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Create | Edit, View, Delete, Execute | The specific datasource |
| Edit | View, Execute | The specific datasource   | 
| Delete |  View, Execute | The specific datasource | 
| View | Execute | The specific datasource  | 
| Execute |  - | The specific datasource| 


#### Environments

Permissions control the access to the environments within a workspace, and are applicable to all environments for the accessible datasources as defined in the [Datasources](#datasources) section within the workspace. The permissions assigned to environments do not cascade automatically to queries, and you must assign individual permissions to queries under the [Application Resources](#application-resources) tab. 

| Permission | Automatically assigns |  Cascades to resources |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Create | Edit, View, Delete, Execute | All environments for accessible datasources |
| Edit | View, Execute | All environments for accessible datasources  |
