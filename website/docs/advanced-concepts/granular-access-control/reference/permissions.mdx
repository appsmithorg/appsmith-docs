Permissions in Appsmith govern the level of access and actions users can perform on specific resources within the platform. To assign appropriate permissions to resources, so users can efficiently complete their tasks, it's crucial to understand the permissions, their interdependencies, and their cascading impact. This page provides an in-depth overview of permissions, their assignments, and interdependencies within the Appsmith access control system.

## Create permission

The **Create** permission allows users to add new resources in Appsmith. This permission not only grants the ability to create but also includes additional permissions for managing and interacting with those resources. When assigned to a parent resource, the **Create** permission and its associated permissions are inherited by child resources, ensuring consistent access across the hierarchy.

## Make Public permission

The **Make Public** permission permits users to change the access level of applications, making them available to the public. When the **Make Public** permission is assigned to a workspace or an application, it, along with the automatically assigned permissions, are inherited by the child resources. Once granted, users can enable the **Make application public** option on the _Invite Users_ modal to make an application publicly available. This option allows external users to access the app without the need to log in to Appsmith.
