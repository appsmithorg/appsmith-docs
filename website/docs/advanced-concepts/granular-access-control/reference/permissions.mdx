Permissions in Appsmith govern the level of access and actions users can perform on specific resources within the platform. To assign appropriate permissions to resources, so users can efficiently complete their tasks, it's crucial to understand the permissions, their interdependencies, and their cascading impact. This page provides an in-depth overview of permissions, their assignments, and interdependencies within the Appsmith access control system.

## Create permission

The **Create** permission defines which resources users are allowed to create. Once granted, it permits users to create new resources in Appsmith. When the **Create** permission is assigned to a parent resource, it, along with the automatically assigned permissions, are inherited by the child resources.
