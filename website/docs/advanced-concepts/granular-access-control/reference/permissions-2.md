Permissions in Appsmith govern the level of access and actions users can perform on specific resources within the platform. To assign appropriate permission to resources so that a user can efficiently complete their job, understanding the permissions, their interdependencies and cascading impact is paramount. This page provides an in-depth overview of permissions, their hierarchy levels, automatic assignments, and interdependencies within the Appsmith access control system.


## Create

The **Create** permission defines which resources are eligible for creation, and once mapped allows users to create new resources in Appsmith. Depending on the hierarchical level where the permission is assigned, it will have a cascading effect and all the child resources


## Permission levels

The below permission levels based on the resources to which they are assigned in Appsmith.

### Workspace level

When a permission is assigned at a workspace level, it impacts all the resources underneath it. For example, there is a workspace - `UserApps` and you assigned `Create` permission to it, then all the apps in the `UserApps` workspace, and their resources like pages, and queries will also have a `Create` permission assigned to it.

### Application level

When a permission is assigned at an application level, it impacts all the resources underneath it. For example, there is an application - `UserReports` and you assigned `Edit` permission to it, then all the pages and their queries in the `UserReports` application will also be assigned a `Create` permission.

### Group level

### Role level

### Resource level

At resource level, you choose to assign individual permissions to resources, and they do not have a cascading impact. For example, if you choose to assign a `Edit` permission to `getAllUsers` query, this permission will only be applicable to this resource and have no impact on above hierarchies.

### Others


## Permission interdependencies

Permissions are interdependent on each other within the hierarchy levels also. Some permissions like `Create` when assigned automatically also assigns `Edit`, `Delete`, and `View` permissions to same resources, and also cascade to lower levels. Below tabular representation showcases the hierarchy levels and permission interdependencies:

## Permissions

Below permissions are available in Appsmith along with the hierarchy level they are available and if they have interdependencies.

### Create

The **Create** permission defines which resources are eligible for creation, and once mapped allows users to create new resources in Appsmith.

| Permission | Hierarchy Level | Cascades 
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Create | Workspace-level | Edit, View, Delete |
| Create | Application-level | Edit, View, Delete | Applications, Pages, Queries, Datasources, Environments, Groups, Roles, and Workflows |

  - first level hierarchy - Permissions at this level cascade down to all sub-resources within each category.
  - second level hierarchy - Permissions at this level apply only to specific sub-resources within each category.

  A table that shows how the permission hierarchy maps to each resource:

| Permission | Hierarchy Level | Cascades | Resources | 
|------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Create | Workspace-level, Application-level, Resource-level | Edit, View, Delete | Applications, Pages, Queries, Datasources, Environments, Groups, Roles, and Workflows |
| Edit | Workspace-level, Application-level, Resource-level | - | Applications, Pages, Queries, Datasources, Environments, Groups, Roles, and Workflows |
| Delete | Workspace-level, Application-level, Resource-level | - | Applications, Pages, Queries, Datasources, Environments, Groups, Roles, and Workflows |
| View | Workspace-level, Application-level, Resource-level | - | Applications, Pages, Queries, Datasources, Environments, Groups, Roles, and Workflows |
| Execute | Resource-level | - | Queries, Datasources, Environments |
| Make Public | Workspace-level, Application-Level | - | Applications, Pages |
| Export | Workspace-level, Application-Level | - | Applications, Pages |
