To secure applications and provide access based on your business needs, Appsmith allows you to create your own custom roles. This page showcases different scenarios and examples for creating custom roles to manage granular access effectively.

## Restrict page access

Controlling access to specific pages within your Appsmith application is vital for maintaining security and privacy. This page provides information on how to restrict page access to designated users or user groups, enabling you to enforce access control effectively.

### Permissions

To restrict page access, you must configure permissions for individual pages within an Appsmith app. For example, to provide access to two different sets of users, create two custom roles, assign appropriate permissions, and assign them to users or groups of users. Let's name the roles **Manage Loans** and **Manage Reports**, and permissions so that each role has access to different pages in the application. The **Manage Loans** role has access to review loan applications, and the **Manage Reports** role has access to review reports:

#### Manage loans role
The tabs below show the permissions assigned to different resources for Manage loans role:
<Tabs queryString="gac-resource">
   <TabItem label="Application Resources" value="application-resources">
    <ZoomImage
         src="/img/restrict-page-access-manage-loan-app-resources.png" 
         alt="Configuration for Application Resources"
         caption="Configuration for Application Resources"
      ></ZoomImage>
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Datasources & Environments" value="datasources-and-environments">
   <ZoomImage
         src="/img/restrict-page-access-manage-loan-data-envs.png" 
         alt="Configuration for Application Resources"
         caption="Configuration for Datasources & Environments"
      ></ZoomImage>
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Manage reports role

The tabs below show the permissions assigned to different resources for Manage reports role:

<Tabs queryString="gac-resource">
   <TabItem label="Application Resources" value="application-resources">
    <ZoomImage
         src="/img/restrict-page-access-manage-report-app-resources.png" 
         alt="Configuration for Application Resources"
         caption="Configuration for Application Resources"
      ></ZoomImage>
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Datasources & Environments" value="datasources-and-environments">
   <ZoomImage
         src="/img/restrict-page-access-manage-loan-data-envs.png" 
         alt="Configuration for Application Resources"
         caption="Configuration for Datasources & Environments"
      ></ZoomImage>
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>
