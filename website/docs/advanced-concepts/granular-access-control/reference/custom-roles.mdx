To secure applications and provide access based on your business needs, Appsmith allows you to create custom roles. This page showcases different scenarios and examples for creating custom roles to manage granular access effectively.

## Restrict page access

To restrict access to specific pages within your Appsmith application, you need to configure permissions at the page level. Create custom roles, assign appropriate permissions, and assign them to users or groups of users.

For example, in a loan application, you may want to:
- Restrict access to the loan application page for users designated to review reports.
- Restrict access to reports for users designated to review loan applications.

Here, you define two roles:
- **Manage loans** - Access to review loan applications.
- **Manage reports** - Access to review reports.

### Manage loans role

The tabs below show the permissions assigned to different resources for the Manage Loans role:

<Tabs queryString="gac-resource">
   <TabItem label="Application Resources" value="application-resources">
    <ZoomImage
         src="/img/restrict-page-access-manage-loan-app-resources.png" 
         alt="Configuration for Application Resources"
         caption="Configuration for Application Resources"
    ></ZoomImage>
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Datasources & Environments" value="datasources-and-environments">
   <ZoomImage
         src="/img/restrict-page-access-manage-loan-data-envs.png" 
         alt="Configuration for Datasources & Environments"
         caption="Configuration for Datasources & Environments"
    ></ZoomImage>
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Manage reports role

The tabs below show the permissions assigned to different resources for the Manage Reports role:

<Tabs queryString="gac-resource">
   <TabItem label="Application Resources" value="application-resources">
    <ZoomImage
         src="/img/restrict-page-access-manage-report-app-resources.png" 
         alt="Configuration for Application Resources"
         caption="Configuration for Application Resources"
    ></ZoomImage>
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Datasources & Environments" value="datasources-and-environments">
   <ZoomImage
         src="/img/restrict-page-access-manage-loan-data-envs.png" 
         alt="Configuration for Datasources & Environments"
