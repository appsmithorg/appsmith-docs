# Roles
Roles in Appsmith are collections of permissions that enable users or groups to access certain operations on resources. Rather than giving individual permissions to users or groups, roles allow users to manage multiple permissions.

## Instance roles

In addition to the [default](/advanced-concepts/invite-users#built-in-roles) roles for applications and workspace, Appmith provides two instance-level roles - **Default Role for all Users** and **Instance Administrator**.

- **Default Role For All Users**: This role applies to all users and can be used to assign a default set of permissions in an instance. It is editable and does not come with any predefined permissions, and Instance Administrators can customize it and assign default permissions to new users joining the instance. By adjusting the permissions in this role, they can ensure that new users have an appropriate level of access.

- **Instance Administrator**: This role provides a user with permission to modify settings at the instance level from the Admin settings. This includes changing the general settings of the instance, such as authentication, email, custom branding, access to view audit logs and granular access control actions. It's important to note that this role has significant control over the instance, so it should only be assigned to trusted users who need these capabilities.

## Custom roles

With custom roles, you can provide fine-grained access control by configuring multiple permissions for the role you are creating. To create a custom role, go to **Admin Settings** > **Access Control** > **Roles** and click the **Add Role** button.

The permissions are grouped into four categories, which helps users manage and access the necessary permissions easily:

- [Application Resources](#application-resources)
- [Datasource and Environments](#datasource-and-environments)
- [Groups and Roles](#groups-and-roles)
- [Others](#others)


### Application resources

In this section, you'll find permissions related to the application and its resources such as pages, widgets, and queries. The table below illustrates the permissions that can be assigned to either a user or a group. Additionally, it explains how each permission behaves at various hierarchical levels.

|   | <div style= {{width:"180px"}}> **Create** </div>| <div style= {{width:"180px"}}> **Edit** </div> | <div style= {{width:"180px"}}> **Delete** </div> | <div style= {{width:"180px"}}> **View** </div> | <div style= {{width:"180px"}}> **Execute** </div> | <div style= {{width:"180px"}}> **Public** </div> | <div style= {{width:"180px"}}> **Export** </div> |
