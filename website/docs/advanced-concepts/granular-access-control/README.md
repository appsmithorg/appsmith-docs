Granular access control is a fundamental aspect of Appsmith's security architecture, offering management over user permissions within workspaces. This feature helps organizations to finely tune access levels, ensuring that users only have the necessary privileges to perform their designated tasks, thereby enhancing security and mitigating risks.

## Key features

- **Role-Based Access:** Appsmith uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system, enabling instance administrators to assign distinct roles to users based on their responsibilities and authority levels within the organization. It also provides Default Roles to enable easy integration of access control. For more information, see [Default Roles](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/roles#default-roles).

- **Workspace Permissions:** With granular control over workspace permissions, administrators can dictate precisely which actions users can perform within a given workspace, such as creating, editing, or deleting apps, managing pages, queries, datasources, and environments. For more information, see [Permissions](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/permissions).

- **Resource-Level Permissions:** Users are granted permissions at a granular level, regulating access to individual resources like apps, pages, queries, datasources, and environments, ensuring that sensitive data and functionalities remain protected. For more information, see [Permissions](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/permissions).

- **Customizable Permissions:** Administrators have the flexibility to create custom roles and tailoring access rights to align with organizational policies and security requirements. For more information, see [Custom Roles](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/roles#custom-roles).

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security:** Granular access control reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches by restricting users' access to only the necessary resources and functionalities required to fulfill their roles.

- **Compliance Adherence:** Appsmith's granular access control features aid organizations in meeting regulatory compliance standards by enforcing strict access controls and maintaining audit trails of user activities.

- **Improved Collaboration:** By granting users access to specific resources based on their roles and responsibilities, granular access control facilitates seamless collaboration while maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.

- **Scalability:** As organizations grow and evolve, Appsmith's granular access control scales effortlessly, accommodating changes in user roles, permissions, and resource access requirements without compromising security or efficiency.

## Getting started

Granular access control is an indispensable component of Appsmith's comprehensive security framework, providing organizations with the tools needed to enforce stringent access controls, safeguard sensitive data, and promote secure collaboration across teams. By leveraging granular access control features, organizations can strengthen their security posture, enhance regulatory compliance, and foster a culture of responsible data management and governance.
