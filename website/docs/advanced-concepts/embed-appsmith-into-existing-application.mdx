# Embed Appsmith

Integrating an embedded Appsmith application with Single Sign-On (SSO) is essential for seamless user authentication and authorization within your application ecosystem. This page shows how to embed an Appsmith app in your parent application.

## Prerequisites

* **Self-hosted Appsmith Instance**- Ensure you have a self-hosted instance of Appsmith. See the [Appsmith installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) for detailed instructions on setting up your Appsmith instance.

## Public Embed

Embedding Appsmith in a public mode means that the Appsmith app is publicly accessible, and users do not need to log in to Appsmith to access it. Follow the steps below to embed Appsmith in public mode:

1. Navigate to **App Settings** > **Share & Embed** in your Appsmith application.
2. Copy the provided **Embed URL**.
3. Within the same **App Settings** > **Share & Embed** section, toggle the **Make application public** setting.
4. Deploy your app by clicking the **Deploy** button in the top right corner.
5. Use an HTML `<iframe>` and set the **Embed URL** (from step 2) as its source in your application. See the code snippet below, where the `<iframe>` with a unique ID `embeddedAppsmith` will host the embedded Appsmith app:

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      <title>Your App Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <!-- Replace "<Embed_URL>" with your actual Embed URL -->
      <!--highlight-next-line-->
      <iframe id="embeddedAppsmith" src="<Embed_URL>" scrolling="yes"
       seamless="seamless" style="display:block; width:100%; height:100vh;"></iframe>
  </body>
  </html>
```
6. Launch and access your application. You will see that the embedded Appsmith app is rendered in the HTML iframe.

## Private Embed

<Tags
  tags={[
    {
      name: "Business",
      link: "https://www.appsmith.com/pricing",
      additionalClass: "business",
    }
  ]}
/>
</div>

:::caution
* SSO in private embeds isn't supported for GitHub OAuth 2.0.
* When configuring Google OAuth 2.0, the parent and child can be two OAuth 2.0 clients under the same project.

Embedding Appsmith in a private mode means restricting access to the Appsmith app to ensure only authorized users can access it. It helps in increased security. Follow the steps below to embed Appsmith in private mode:

1. **Sub-domains under the Same Domain**: Host the Appsmith app under the sub-domain of the same domain as the parent app, that involves setting up both the parent app and the Appsmith app as sub-domains under the same domain. For example, appsmith.company.com and internal.company.com sharing the same domain (company.com).
2. **Configured SSO Provider**- Set up your Single Sign-On (SSO) provider on your Appsmith instance. See the [SSO configuration guides](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/authentication) for detailed steps on configuring your SSO provider.
3. Go to the **App Settings** > **Share & Embed** within your Appsmith application.
4. Copy the provided **Embed URL**.
5. Deploy the Appsmith app by clicking the **Deploy** button in the top right corner.
6. Use an HTML `<iframe>` and set the **Embed URL** (from step 4) as its source in your application. See the code snippet below, where the `<iframe>` with a unique ID, `embeddedAppsmith` will host the embedded Appsmith app:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      <title>Your App Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <!-- Replace "<Embed_URL>" with your actual Embed URL -->
       <!--highlight-next-line-->
      <iframe id="embeddedAppsmith" src="<Embed_URL>" scrolling="yes"
       seamless="seamless" style="display:block; width:100%; height:100vh;"></iframe>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
7. Launch and log into your application. Once you login to your parent app and are authenticated, you can see that the embedded Appsmith app is rendered in the HTML iframe. You can also watch the video on [how to embed Appsmith in private mode](https://youtube.com/embed/Zoiy1tKcjzU?autoplay=1).
8. Appsmith automatically populates the following tokens, which you can use in your Appsmith apps to interact securely with your APIs and queries:
    * Client-side tokens - Use these tokens in JS Objects, APIs or queries on Appsmith
      * `{{appsmith.user.idToken}}`
      * `{{appsmith.user.rawIdToken}}`
      * `{{ appsmith.user.userClaims }}`
    * Server-side token - Use this in your Appsmith API header to securely authorize your users.
      * `<<APPSMITH_USER_OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN>>`

For more information, see [Identity and Access Tokens](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/authentication/json-web-tokens-jwt).

## Troubleshooting

If you face difficulties viewing the embedded Appsmith App, consider the following solutions:

* Ensure that Frame ancestors include the parent app domain if you have restricted access for embedding Appsmith. For more information, see [Frame ancestors](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/frame-ancestors).
* Use HTTPS for the Appsmith instance and the parent application to avoid potential issues.
* If you use Firefox, be aware of additional third-party cookie restrictions that may affect private embeds.
* Users might experience problems when strict third-party cookie-sharing restrictions are enabled on their browsers.

If you continue to face issues, contact the support team using the chat widget at the bottom right of this page.
