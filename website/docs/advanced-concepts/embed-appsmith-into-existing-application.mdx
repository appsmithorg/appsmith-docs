# Embed Appsmith

To embed an Appsmith application into your website, follow the steps below:


<Tabs queryString="public-app">
<TabItem label="Public application" value="public-application">

## Prerequisites

To embed Appsmith in your web page or web application, ensure that the hosting of the said web page or application is done on a server.

## Get embed URL

1. Open your Appsmith application and click **App Settings > Share & Embed**.
2. Copy the **Embed URL**.
3. On your web application, add the **Embed URL** to the `src` attribute of the `iframe` tag. You can set the dimensions of the embedded application using the `height` and `width` attributes as shown below:

```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
#highlight-next-line
    <iframe src="<Embed_URL>" scrolling="yes" seamless="seamless" style="display:block; width:100%; height:100vh;"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Private application" value="private-application">

:::info
Embedding private applications is only available in Appsmith's [Business Edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).
:::

## Prerequisites

* The Appsmith app and the parent app should be under sub-domains of the same domain. For eg. `appsmith.company.com` and `internal.company.com`.
* You must configure the same SSO identity provider(IDP) on the Appsmith and the parent applications.

## Get embed URL

1. Open your Appsmith application and click **App Settings > Share & Embed**.
2. To configure the Appsmith application with the SSO of your parent application, select the preferred SSO type from the **SSO method** list.
3. Copy the **Embed URL**.
3. On your web application, add the **Embed URL** to the `src` attribute of the `iframe` tag. You can set the dimensions of the embedded application using the `height` and `width` attributes as shown below:

```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
#highlight-next-line
    <iframe src="<Embed_URL>" scrolling="yes" seamless="seamless" style="display:block; width:100%; height:100vh;"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```

## Important notes
* The feature may not work on `HTTP` URLs. Use `HTTPS` for both the Appsmith instance and the parent application.
* Firefox has additional third-party cookie restrictions that may cause issues with private embeds.
* Users may see issues when strict third-party cookie-sharing restrictions are enabled on the browser. 
* SSO in private embeds isn't supported for GitHub OAuth 2.0.
* For Google OAuth 2.0 configuration, the parent and child can be two OAuth 2.0 clients under the same project.

</TabItem>
