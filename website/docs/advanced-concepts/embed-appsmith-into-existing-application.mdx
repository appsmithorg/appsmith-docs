# Share SSO Token with Embedded Appsmith

When integrating an embedded Appsmith application with Single Sign-On (SSO), it's crucial to share SSO tokens to authenticate and authorize your app users. This doc outlines the steps to integrate and share SSO tokens from your app to an embedded Appsmith app.

## Prerequisites

* A self-hosted Appsmith instance. See the [Appsmith installation guides](/getting-started/setup/installation-guides) for installing Appsmith.
* Your Single Sign-On (SSO) provider configured on your Appsmith instance. See the [SSO configuration guides](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/authentication) to configure your SSO provider.
* The Appsmith app and the parent app should be under sub-domains of the same domain. For eg. `appsmith.company.com` and `internal.company.com`.

## Embed Appsmith
You may choose to embed Appsmith app in one of the following ways:
* **Public application** - The Appsmith app is publicly available and doesn't need you to log into Appsmith to access it.
* **Private application** - The Appsmith app has restricted access and only authorized users can access it. Embedding Appsmith in a private mode is only available as part of [paid plans](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).

Follow the steps below to embed your Appsmith app:

1. Open your Appsmith application and click **App Settings > Share & Embed**.
2. Copy the **Embed URL**.
3. On your application, use a HTML Iframe and set the **Embed URL** as the source of the iframe. In the below code, provide a unique id to the iframe. For example, `embeddedAppsmith`

  ```bash
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
      <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
  #highlight-next-line
      <!-- Remember to change the "<Embed_URL>" placeholder below.-->
      <iframe id="embeddedAppsmith" src="<Embed_URL>" scrolling="yes" seamless="seamless" style="display:block; width:100%; height:100vh;"></iframe>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

:::caution
* SSO in private embeds isn't supported for GitHub OAuth 2.0.
* For Google OAuth 2.0 configuration, the parent and child can be two OAuth 2.0 clients under the same project.

When a user logs in to your application using SSO, and you have the SSO token from your authentication provider, share this token with the embedded Appsmith app to authenticate the user. Follow the below steps to share the SSO token:

### Send SSO token to Appsmith
Pass the token to the embedded Appsmith app by using `postMessage` method:

  ```js
    const iframe = document.getElementById('embeddedAppsmith');
    // verify that iframe and authToken are available
    if (iframe && authToken) {
      //replace the `<Appsmith_hosted_url>`placeholder with your Appsmith application domain
      iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ messageType: 'AUTH_TOKEN', token: authToken},
      '<Appsmith_hosted_url>');
    }
  ```

### Read and verify token in Appsmith

To read the token in the Appsmith use the [windowMessageListener](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions/window-message-listener) method. For managing the token, use the Appsmith store to store the token, token's expiry and request to refresh the token on expiry. Follow the below steps to create a JS Object that serves as the token manager:

  * Create a JS Object named `js_manage_sso_tokens`, and remove the auto-generated code.
  * Add code to read the message sent from the parent app, parse the token for expiry, store the token and its expiry in the Appsmith store, and verify token expiry:

    ```js
    export default {
      //read the message
      async readAuthToken () {
         //replace the '<origin' placeholder with your application domain
        // from where the message had originated
        await windowMessageListener('<origin>', (message) => {
        const {type, token} = message;
        if(type === 'AUTH_TOKEN')
            this.storeTokenInAppsmithStore(token);
        })
      },
      //store the token and its expiry in the store
      storeTokenInAppsmithStore(ssoToken) {
        // add the sso token and its expiry in the store
        //using the storeValue() function
        storeValue("authToken", ssoToken);
        storeValue("authTokenExpiry", this.getTokenExpiry(ssoToken));
      },
      //parse the token for expiry
      getTokenExpiry(token) {
        try {
          return JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1])).exp;  
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error decoding token:', error);
          return null; 
        }
      },
      verifyAuthTokenExpiry() {
        //verify the token expiry by accessing the token expiry from the store
        // and comparing it with the current timestamp
        return moment().utc() > moment().utc(appsmith.store.authTokenExpiry);
      }
    }
    ```
  
  ### Bind token to call APIs in Appsmith

  Once you have the SSO token, you need to bind it to the Appsmith APIs and queries. Follow these steps to ensure the token is sent:

  * Retrieve the token from the Appsmith store and set it in the Authorization header or as per the expectation of the API that you are calling.

  ### Request a token refresh on expiry

  To request a new token, verify the token expiry by calling the method `verifyAuthTokenExpiry` of `js_manage_sso_tokens` that retrieves the expiry timestamp of the SSO token from the store and compares it with current timestamp, and returns `true` when a token expires. On token expiry, communicate with the parent app by using [postWindowMessage](/reference/appsmith-framework/widget-actions/post-message) method to send a token expiry message. Add a new function to `js_manage_sso_tokens` JS Object to request for refreshing the token:

   ```js
   requestToRefreshToken() {
    if(this.verifyAuthTokenExpiry()){
      postWindowMessage('{ messageType: \'AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED\', 
      token: ' + appsmith.store.authToken + ' }', "window", "*");
    }
   }
   ```

### Read the updated token

In the parent app, listen for the message from the embedded Appsmith app indicating the token expiry, generate a new SSO token and send it back to the embedded app. Add the below code in your parent app:

```js
//add this code in your parent app to handle token refresh
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  const { messageType } = event.data;
  if (messageType === 'AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED') {

    // Add coode to generate a new SSO token
    
    //replace the `<Appsmith_hosted_url>` and `new_token` placeholders 
    // with your Appsmith application domain and the newly generated token respectively
    iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ messageType: 'REFRESH_AUTH_TOKEN', token: <new_token> }, '<Appsmith_hosted_url>');
  }
});
```

### Update token in store

In the embedded Appsmith app, listen for the message from the parent app containing the new token and update the Appsmith store. Add a new function to `js_manage_sso_tokens` JS Object to update the store with the new token:

```js
  async readandUpdateNewAuthToken () {
      //replace the '<origin' placeholder with your application domain
    // from where the message had originated
    await windowMessageListener('<origin>', (message) => {
    const {type, token} = message;
    if(type === 'REFRESH_AUTH_TOKEN')
        this.storeTokenInAppsmithStore(token);
    })
  }
```

## Troubleshooting

You may face some common errors as listed below:

  - If you have restricted the access for embedding Appsmith, ensure that the Frame ancesorts has the parent app domain added. For more information, see [Frame ancestors](/getting-started/setup/instance-configuration/frame-ancestors).
  - If you are not able to send or receive messages:
    * Verify that the apps are available under sub-domains of the same domain.
    * Use `HTTPS` for both the Appsmith instance and the parent application.
    * If you are using Firefox, it has an additional third-party cookie restrictions that may cause issues with private embeds.
    * Users may see issues when strict third-party cookie-sharing restrictions are enabled on the browser.
