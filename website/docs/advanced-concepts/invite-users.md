# Share Workspace

To enhance productivity and efficiency, collaboration within your team is essential. Sharing your applications facilitates this collaboration. This page provides instructions on how to share your workspace and its app.

## Invite users to workspace

Follow these steps to invite users to a workspace:

1. Navigate to the homepage and select the workspace you wish to share.
2. Click the **Share** button located in the top right corner.
3. In the **Invite users** modal, enter the email address of the user and select an appropriate role for them.
4. Click the **Invite** button to send the invitation.

If you are using the Appsmith Community Edition, you can only share your entire workspace, along with all the applications within the workspace with the users. However, with the Appsmith Business plan, you have the capability to share specific applications with users. For more information, see the [Share Application](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/how-to-guides/share-application) guide that provides instructions on sharing individual applications.
