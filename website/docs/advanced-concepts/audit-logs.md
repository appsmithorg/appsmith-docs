The audit log is a paper trail of all notable activities on an Appsmith instance. It automatically captures and displays events by recording what activity was performed, who performed it, and when it occurred. With this information, you can ensure that you're able to follow up and address any unexpected or undesirable events.

There are several kinds of events that are logged:

- App-specific activity
  - Changes to pages
  - Datasource configuration
  - Query configuration and execution
  - Deleting apps
- Changes to Administrator settings
  - Instance configuration changes
- User sign-up and login activity

To access the audit logs, on the homepage, go to **Admin Settings > Others > Audit logs**. Within this tab, you can see a list of events that have been tracked under your organization's account. To view the details of a specific event, click on the event description to expand the event and display a complete set of details in JSON format.
