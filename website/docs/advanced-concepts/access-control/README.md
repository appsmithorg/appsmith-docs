# Share Applications

Appsmith allows you to collaborate with your team members or share your application with the end user. There are multiple ways to share your application in Appsmith. You can either share your workspace or share a specific application.

## Share workspace

When you share a workspace with a user, they can access all the applications in that workspace. Follow the steps below to share a workspace:
1. Open the workspace homepage and navigate to the workspace you want to share.
2. Click **Share** from the right corner, enter the email of the user and select an appropriate role for them.
3. Click **Invite**.

If you are using Appsmith's community edition, it's important to note that the steps provided below for inviting a user to an application grant access to the entire workspace, 

:::info
Sharing specific applications in a workspace is only available for the business edition.
:::
If you want the user to just have access to a specific application in a workspace, follow the steps below:

1. Open the app you want to share and click **Share** at the top right corner.
2. Enter the email of the user and select an appropriate role for them.
3. Click **Invite**.

### Make application public

You can make your applications public and share them with users who are not part of your workspace. These external users do not need to authenticate to access the shared applications.

To make an application public, you can click on the **Share** button within the application and turn on the **Make application public** switch. Once enabled, a link to the application is displayed in a modal. To share the application, simply copy the link and share it with your intended users. They can now access the application without having to log in to your workspace.

:::info
Only developers with Administrator roles can make applications public.

## Default roles

In Appsmith, default roles refer to the roles that are automatically generated by the system when you create an Instance or a Workspace. These roles are predefined and cannot be deleted by the user. There are three default roles provided by Appsmith:

- Administrator
- Developer 
- App Viewer 

The table below shows the permissions valid for the respective role:
