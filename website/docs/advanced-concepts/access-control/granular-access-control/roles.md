# Roles
Roles in Appsmith are collections of permissions that enable users or groups to access certain operations on resources. Rather than giving individual permissions to users or groups, roles allow users to manage multiple permissions.

You have two types of roles in Appsmith:

- **Default Roles** 
- **Custom Roles** 

## Default roles

Default roles are automatically generated by Appsmith during the creation of an instance or workspace, and they cannot be edited or deleted by the user.

Appsmith provides three built-in roles - **Administrator**, **Developer**, and **App Viewer**. 

:::info
The **Default Role For All Users** role sets the base level of access given to all users of an instance. The Instance Administrators can modify this role to provide the right level of access to their new users.

## Custom role

With custom roles, you can provide fine-grained access control by configuring multiple permissions for the role you are creating. To create a custom role, go to **Admin Settings** > **Access Control** > **Roles** and click the **Add Role** button.

## Configure roles

To create or edit a role, you need to set up the permissions based on your requirements. The permissions are grouped into four categories, which helps users manage and access the necessary permissions easily. The four categories are:

- Application Resources
- Datasource and Queries
- Groups and Roles
- Others


### Application resources

In this section, you'll find permissions related to the application and its resources such as pages, widgets, and queries. The table below illustrates the permissions that can be assigned to either a user or a group. Additionally, it explains how each permission behaves at various hierarchical levels.
