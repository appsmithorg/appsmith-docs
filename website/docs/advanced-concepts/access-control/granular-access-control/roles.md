# Roles
Roles in Appsmith are collections of permissions that enable users or groups to access certain operations on resources. Rather than giving individual permissions to users or groups, roles allow users to manage multiple permissions.

You have two types of roles in Appsmith:

- **Default Roles** 
- **Custom Roles** 

## Default roles

Default roles are automatically generated by Appsmith during the creation of an instance or workspace, and they cannot be edited or deleted by the user.

Appsmith provides three built-in roles - **Administrator**, **Developer**, and **App Viewer**. 

:::info
The **Default Role For All Users** role sets the base level of access given to all users of an instance. The Instance Administrators can modify this role to provide the right level of access to their new users. 
:::

## Custom role

With custom roles, you can provide fine-grained access control by configuring multiple permissions for the role you are creating. To create a custom role, go to **Admin Settings** > **Access Control** > **Roles** and click the **Add Role** button. 


## Permissions

Permission refers to the ability to perform a particular operation on a resource. You can club multiple permissions under a role, and permission can be present in various roles. The table below lists all the permissions available in Appsmith -


|  Permissions       |    Description                                                     |   Resource   |
| ---------------    |------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Create**         | Enables permission to create, edit, view, and delete resources. You can also grant users access to create groups and roles. | [Application Resources](#application-resources-permissions), [Datasource and queries](#datasource-and-queries-permissions), [Groups and roles](#groups-and-roles-permissions), [others](#others-permissions). |
| **Edit**           |Enables permission to edit and view resources. You can also grant users access to create groups and roles | [Application Resources](#application-resources-permissions), [Datasource and queries](#datasource-and-queries-permissions), [Groups and roles](#groups-and-roles-permissions), [others](#others-permissions). |
| **View**           |Enables permission to only view resources. With the View permission, a user can only view the existing groups and roles | [Application Resources](#application-resources-permissions), [Datasource and queries](#datasource-and-queries-permissions), [Groups and roles](#groups-and-roles-permissions), [others](#others-permissions). |
| **Delete**         |Enables permission to delete resources. You can also grant users access to delete groups and roles |[Application Resources](#application-resources-permissions), [Datasource and queries](#datasource-and-queries-permissions), [Groups and roles](#groups-and-roles-permissions), [others](#others-permissions). |  
| **Export**         |Grants users permission to export applications in a workspace. | [Application Resources](#application-resources-permissions) | 
| **Invite**         |Grants users permission to invite users to a user group | [Groups and roles](#groups-and-roles-permissions)     |
| **Make public**    |Grants users permission to make the applications public in a workspace |[Application Resources](#application-resources-permissions)|
| **Execute**        |Grants users permission to execute queries on a datasource | [Datasource and queries](#datasource-and-queries-permissions) |
| **Remove users**   |Grants users permission to remove a user from a group| [Groups and roles](#groups-and-roles-permissions) |

## Resources

In Appsmith, a resource refers to a specific component or aspect of an application that users can access or modify. These resources include individual pages or views within the application, datasources or queries, or specific actions or functions that can be performed within the application. These are classified into the following categories:

* **Application Resources:** These are resources that relate to applications built in Appsmith, such as individual pages or views within the application.
* **Datasource and Queries:** These are resources that relate to databases or queries created in Appsmith, such as a MongoDB setup used as a datasource.
* **Groups and Roles:** These are resources related to the roles available for the workspaces and custom groups & roles available in an Appsmith instance. For example, if you have two workspaces - H.R. and Finance - then roles related to H.R. and finance would be available.
* **Others:** These are resources related to workspaces and audit logs in Appsmith.

By organizing resources into categories, Appsmith makes it easier for users to manage and access the resources they need.

The permissions that can be configured for each resource while creating a custom role is explained below.

### Application resources permissions

In Application Resources, the table below shows the permissions that can be assigned to a user or a group and how each permission behaves at different heirarchial levels:

|  <div style= {{width:"120px"}}>Heirarchy</div> | <div style= {{width:"150px"}}> Create </div>| <div style= {{width:"150px"}}> Edit </div> | <div style= {{width:"150px"}}> Delete </div> | <div style= {{width:"150px"}}> View </div> | <div style= {{width:"150px"}}> Public </div> | <div style= {{width:"150px"}}> Export </div> |
