# Roles
 A Role is a collection of permissions that you can define and assign to user or a group. Roles allow you to adjust multiple permissions easily rather than assigning individual permissions to users/groups. 
 
 In Appsmith, a role can contain multiple permissions and a permission can be present in multiple roles. However, a role cannot be nested, i.e, it can contain only permissions, not other roles. In an Appsmith instance, there are three roles available by default -

 1. **Admin**
 2. **Developer**
 3. **App Viewer**
