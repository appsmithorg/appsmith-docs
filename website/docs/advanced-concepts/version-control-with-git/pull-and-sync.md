# Pull Changes

When you make changes to the remote repository of the Appsmith app (Eg. - merged a pull request to the master branch), the local counterpart has to be updated with those changes. To sync the local branch with the remote updates, pull the latest changes by clicking on the **pull icon** at the bottom left corner.

Once the pull is successful, the app is automatically deployed. You can view the deployed version by clicking the **ï¹€** icon from the top right corner.

:::info
The pull function can sometimes result in merge conflicts if there are changes made to the same files in both the local and remote branch. In such cases, resolve the conflicts manually on the remote repository.
