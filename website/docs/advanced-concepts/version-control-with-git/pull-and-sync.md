# Pull Changes

In Git, a pull is a command that updates a local repository with changes from a remote repository. Similarly, when you make changes to the remote repository of the Appsmith app (Eg. - merged a pull request to the main branch), the local counterpart has to be updated with those changes. 

To sync the local branch with the remote updates, pull the latest changes by clicking on the **pull icon** at the bottom left corner.

:::info
The pull function can sometimes result in merge conflicts if there are changes made to the same files in both the local and remote repositories. In such cases, resolve the conflicts manually on the remote repository.
