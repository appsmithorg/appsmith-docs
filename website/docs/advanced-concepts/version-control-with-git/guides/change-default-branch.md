When you create a new repository, Git automatically creates a default branch, often named `master` or `main`. You have the option to select a different default branch for each instance.

The default branch is the base branch of the app. If there is no branch tag in the URL, the user is directed to the app associated with this branch.

1. Open **Git Settings** located on the left side of the bottom bar.

2. Navigate to the branch tab.

3. Change the default branch and click on the **Update** button. Once the default branch is updated, users launching the app from the dashboard sees the deployed version from this branch.
