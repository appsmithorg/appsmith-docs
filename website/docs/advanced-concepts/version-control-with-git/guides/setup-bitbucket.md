1. Open the Appsmith app you want to connect to Git and click the **Connect Git** button on the left of the bottom bar.

2. Select **Bitbucket** as the service provider.

Version Control works with any Git hosting service that supports the SSH protocol and deploy keys. HTTPS Git connections are not currently supported in Appsmith.

3. Create a new Git repository if you don't already have one. The connection may fail if the repository is not empty. See [How to create a new repository / project](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-git-repository/)


4. After setting up an empty repository, navigate to the repository's landing page, click on the **Clone** button, select **SSH** and copy the **SSH** URL.

5. Paste the SSH URL into the **Generate SSH Key** section in Appsmith, remove the `git clone` from the URL. 

6. Click the **Generate SSH Keys** button, and unique `ECDSA 256` and `RSA 4096` keys are displayed. Choose the appropriate key based on your specific security requirements and system constraints.

7. Copy one of the keys, then navigate to your **Workspace settings**. Proceed to **SSH keys**, click on **Add SSH key**, paste the copied key, and provide a meaningful title for future reference.

8. In Appsmith, click the **Connect Git** button.

With these steps, you have successfully connected to Git.

:::caution
A user needs to have **Create** permission for application resources on the workspace to be able to connect or disconnect an app to Git. For more information, see [Create Permission](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/reference/permissions#create-permission).
