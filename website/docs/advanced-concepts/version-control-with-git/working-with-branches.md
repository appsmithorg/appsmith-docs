# Working with Branches

The initial commit while connecting to a repository is made to the master branch. If you want to work on a feature independently, you can create a separate branch.

To create a new branch -

* Click on the branch button at the bottom left corner. You can switch to an existing branch or create a new one from the branch pop-up.
* If you create a new branch, it will have the uncommitted changes of your parent branch. 
* When you switch to another branch, the uncommitted changes in your current branch won’t be carried over to the destination branch.

However, if you create a new branch, it will have the uncommitted changes of your parent branch.

:::info
* Branch names should **not** start with `origin/` since this prefix is used to distinguish between local and remote versions of a branch.
* Checking out a remote branch with a local counterpart already available would result in an error.
* Branch protections on remote repository may cause errors with some operations involving Git push.
:::

#### Syncing Local with Remote Branch

To sync the local with the remote branch (fetching or pruning), click on the branch pop-up and hit the **Sync branches** button.

Syncing the branches won’t merge any change you’ve made on the remote branch. You’ll have to click on the pull button to get the latest changes.

### Delete a Branch

Similar to the Git flow, you can delete a branch in Appsmith that is no longer needed.

:::info
You can delete any branch other than the default branch. Please make sure that you are not editing the branch you want to delete.
:::

If you want to delete a branch from Appsmith, follow the steps given below:

1. Click on the branch list at the bottom left corner.
2. Move the cursor to the branch you want to delete, hit the options button, and click on delete branch.
