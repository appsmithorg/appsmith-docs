# Manage Branches

This guide shows you how to create, switch, and delete Git branches within your Appsmith application, allowing you to better manage your app development process at different stages.


:::info
By default, Appsmith enables the protected branch feature for the default (`master/main`) branch. This means that direct edits to this branch are restricted. To make changes, you must create a new branch, implement the changes, and then merge them into the default branch via PR.
:::







## Create branch

To create these branches in your Appsmith app, follow the steps below:


<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "calc(50.520833333333336% + 41px)", height: "0", width: "100%" }}>
  <iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/lpXnJuEduL502KIavxLb?embed" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style={{ position: "absolute", top: "0", left: "0", width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "light" }} title="Appsmith | Connect Data">
  </iframe>
</div>


1. Select the branch menu located at the bottom left corner to access the branch Modal. This modal displays all available remote and local branches.

2. To create a new branch, enter the new branch name (Eg. `feature`) in the input box and click on **Create branch**. Your application switches to the new `(feature)` branch. When you create a new branch, it includes uncommitted changes made in the parent branch. But switching to another branch won't bring along any changes from the previous branch.


Each branch has a unique URL format: `<APPSMITH-APP-URL>?branch=<BRANCH-NAME>`. If the branch name is not specified, the app URL defaults to the `default` branch.

:::note
It's recommended to organize branches according to development phases, such as having a `master/main` branch for stable releases, `feature` branches for new features, and `release` branches for testing and QA purposes.
:::





## Delete local branch

Follow the steps to delete a local branch that is no longer needed:


<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "calc(50.520833333333336% + 41px)", height: "0", width: "100%" }}>
  <iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/jq9yBSnhA8GBOF7VRdb7?embed" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style={{ position: "absolute", top: "0", left: "0", width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "light" }} title="Appsmith | Connect Data">
  </iframe>
</div>

1. Open the branch menu from the bottom left corner.

2. Navigate to the branch you want to delete, click options, and select **Delete**.

With these steps, the local branch gets deleted. To delete a remote branch, you need to delete/remove it from your Git service provider.


## Sync branches

Follow these steps to sync your local branch with its remote counterpart:

1. Open the branch menu from the bottom left corner.

2. Select and open the branch you want to sync.

3. Click on the sync icon ðŸ”„ located at the top-left corner of the branch menu. Syncing the branches wonâ€™t merge any change youâ€™ve made on the remote branch. Youâ€™ll have to click on the pull button to get the latest changes.

The default branch is the base branch of the app. You have the option to select a different default branch for each instance.

## Change protected branch

Protected branches mean that changes to the app are not allowed within those branches. You have to create a new branch to make changes. The default branch is automatically set as the protected branch. You have the option to exclude the default branch from branch protection if needed. 

If you are an enterprise user, you can select multiple branches as protected. Follow these steps to change protected branches:


However, for non-enterprise users,

1. Open **Git Settings** located on the left side of the bottom bar.

2. Navigate to the branch tab.

3. Select the list of branches you want to designate as protected.
