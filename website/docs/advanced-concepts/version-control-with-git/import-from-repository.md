​If you already have an Appsmith App in a Git repository, you can import it to a new workspace or a different Appsmith account. Follow the steps given below:

* On the Appsmith workspace home, click on desired workspace's Menu button and select Import.
* Choose the `Import from a Git repo` option on the import application pop-up. You'll be navigated to an `Import from the Git Repository` screen.
* Add your Repository’s SSH URL and click on [Generate key](connecting-to-git-repository.md#generating-a-deploy-key).

* Add the [Deploy key to your repository.](connecting-to-git-repository.md#adding-the-deploy-key-in-the-repository)​
* Go back to the Git connection window and [configure the user settings](connecting-to-git-repository.md#user-configurations) and click on **Import.**
* Once the import is complete, you’ll see a data source configuration modal where you can configure the data sources used by the imported Application. We do not export any configuration values used for connecting a data source. So either you have to configure it in the data source configuration modal, or you can skip this and choose to configure it later.

:::info
If the imported workspace already has a data source with the same name but a different type, the import will fail due to name conflicts. For example, suppose a git-connected application has a MongoDB data source - "movies." You are importing it to a workspace that has a Postgres data source also named "movies". In such a case, the import will fail.
