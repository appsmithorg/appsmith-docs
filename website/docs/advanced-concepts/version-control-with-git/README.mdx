# Version Control With Git

Version control with Git in Appsmith offers a streamlined solution for application management, allowing you to track changes, rollback, collaborate, set up multiple instances, and more. With Git, you can make changes on separate branches and implement changes via pull requests.

## Core components


- **Version Control Integration:** You can connect with any Git hosting provider of your choice, such as [GitHub](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-github), [GitLab](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-gitlab), [Azure](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-other-provider), [Bitbucket](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-bitbucket), and more.

- **Branch Protection:** You can protect multiple branches to prevent unnecessary commits and maintain the integrity of your codebase.

- **CI/CD Integration:** Supports Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery workflows, enabling automatic updates to the `master` branch and integration with platforms like [GitHub Actions](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-github-actions), [Bitbucket Pipelines](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-bitbucket) and [GitLab CI/CD](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-gitlab).

- **Multiple Instances:** You can create separate isolated environments with different versions and configurations for each stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).



## Getting started
