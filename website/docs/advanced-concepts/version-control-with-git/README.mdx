## Core components


- **Version Control Integration:** You can connect with any Git hosting provider of your choice, such as [GitHub](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-github), [GitLab](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-gitlab), [Azure](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-other-provider), [Bitbucket](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-bitbucket), and more.

- **Branch Protection:** You can protect multiple branches to prevent unnecessary commits and maintain the integrity of your codebase.

- **Default Branch:**  You can change your default branch to set different branches for various environments, such as development, staging, and production. This flexibility helps manage and isolate changes at different stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

- **CI/CD Integration:** Supports Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery workflows, enabling automatic updates to any branch and integration with various CI/CD tools and platforms.

- **Multiple Instances:** You can create separate isolated environments with different versions and configurations for each stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
