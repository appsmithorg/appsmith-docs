# Version Control With Git

Appsmith provides a way to version control your apps by connecting them to a Git hosting provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), making it easier to track changes, create rollbacks or collaborate using git branches.

:::info
In the Community edition, you can connect to **unlimited** public repositories but only up to **three** private repositories in a workspace. To connect more private repositories, you can upgrade to the [Business edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).

Version Control works with any Git hosting service that supports **SSH protocol** and **deploy keys**. HTTPS Git connections are currently not supported on Appsmith.

## Connect to a Git repository

The first step to using version control in Appsmith is to connect your remote repository with the app. Please follow the steps given below:

### Create a new repository

Create a new repository on your Git hosting service and copy the `SSH URL`. The repository should only contain the `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `LICENSE` files.

### Generate a deploy key

1. Open the Appsmith app you want to connect to Git and click the **Connect Git** button on the left of the bottom bar.
2. In the Git connection modal, paste your repository’s `SSH URL` and click the **Generate Key** button to generate an SSH key.

Appsmith supports two types of keys -  **ECDSA 256** and **RSA 4096**. Please pick the one that's compatible with your Git hosting service. 

### Add the deploy key in the Repository

Copy the `SSH key` generated in the preceding section. 

<Tabs queryString="current-edition">
<TabItem label="GitHub" value="github">

* In your repository, go to the **Settings** tab.
* On the navigation bar, under **Security**, click **Deploy Keys**. 
* Click **Add deploy key**. Add a title for the key and paste the generated `SSH key` in the **Key** input box.
* Select the **Allow write access** checkbox.
* Click **Add key**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GitLab" value="gitlab">

* Open the Settings> Repository and expand the deploy keys section.
* Click **Add key** Add the title and paste the generated key in the key section.
* Check the **Grant write permissions** to this key and add the key.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Bitbucket" value="bitbucket">

* Open **Personal settings** from the bottom right corner and under security go to **SSH keys**.
* Click **Add key**, add the label and paste the generated key in the **Key** input box.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### User configuration

* In user settings, define the user configurations. By default, the global user configurations are used. Click the **Edit** button or directly open the profile section to change the global configurations. If you want to add a user configuration specific to the current app, you must clear the **Use Default Configuration** checkbox and enter the author details below.

Finally, click on **connect**, and when the connection is successful, the app is added to your repository by system generated commit. On the Git modal, you’ll move to the **Deploy** tab, where you can make an initial commit.

## Updating local file path (optional)

For self-hosted instances, Appsmith clones the Git repositories in the local file system, attached to the persistent volume within the Docker container. To maintain the Git repositories, you need a file path that points to the volume within the Docker container.

To update the file path to point to a custom Git root where the repositories are persisted:

1.  Update the `APPSMITH_GIT_ROOT` environment variable as shown below:

```
APPSMITH_GIT_ROOT= <path-to-repo-directory>
```

2. Restart the container to apply changes.


:::info
If the file path isn't present, git repositories will be cloned, but this won't be persistent, and Appsmith will try to clone the repositories in case they got deleted by docker restart, etc.
