## Core components


- **Version Control Integration:** You can connect with any Git hosting provider of your choice, such as [GitHub](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-github), [GitLab](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-gitlab), [Azure](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-azure), [Bitbucket](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-bitbucket), and more.

- **Granular Commit Control:** The Git commit modal in Appsmith provides detailed control over changes, allowing you to track and rollback specific changes with precision.

- **Auto-Commit:** Automatically commits changes related to DSL version upgrades, ensuring your app stays updated with the latest features without manual intervention.

- **Secure Secret Management:** Stores configuration securely while excluding sensitive data from version control.

- **CI/CD Integration:** Supports Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery workflows, enabling automatic updates to the `master` branch and integration with platforms like [GitHub Actions](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-github-actions), [Bitbucket Pipelines](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-bitbucket) and [GitLab CI/CD](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-gitlab).

- **Automated Source File Management:** Converts Appsmith application components into source files for Git.




## Getting started

Version control in Appsmith is similar to the traditional Git workflow. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Connect Your App:** Connect your Appsmith app to any Git hosting provider using the SSH URL and Deploy keys.
2. **Setup Branches:** Create separate branches based on your project requirements. Each branch that you create has its own unique URL.
3. **Commit Changes:** Commit and push changes to the remote repository using the **+** plus icon available on the bottom navigation bar.
4. **Merge and Pull:** Merge and pull changes using the properties available on the bottom navigation bar.
5. Automate: Configure CI/CD to automate the integration process.
