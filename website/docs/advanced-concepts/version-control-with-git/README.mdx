# Version Control With Git

Appsmith provides a way to version control your apps by connecting them to a Git hosting provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), making it easier to track changes, rollback changes or collaborate using Git branches.

:::info
In the Community edition, you can connect to **unlimited** public repositories but only up to **three** private repositories in a workspace. To connect more private repositories, you can upgrade to the [Business edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing).
