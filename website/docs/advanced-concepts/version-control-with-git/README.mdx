## Core components


- **Version Control Integration:** You can connect with any Git hosting provider of your choice, such as [GitHub](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-github), [GitLab](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-gitlab), [Azure](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-azure), [Bitbucket](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/guides/setup-bitbucket), and more.

- **CI/CD Integration:** Supports Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery workflows, enabling automatic updates to the `master` branch and integration with platforms like [GitHub Actions](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-github-actions), [Bitbucket Pipelines](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-bitbucket) and [GitLab CI/CD](/advanced-concepts/version-control-with-git/cd-with-gitlab).

- **Auto-Commit:** Automatically commits changes related to Domain Specific Language (DSL) version upgrades, ensuring your app stays updated with the latest features without manual intervention. Whenever you upgrade your Appsmith instance, the DSL that describes your app's layout and interactions is updated.

- **Secure Secret Management:** Securely stores configurations while excluding sensitive data from version control. Credentials used for accessing configured datasources are automatically redacted.


- **Multiple Branch Protection:** You can secure multiple branches by designating them as protected, preventing unnecessary commits and ensuring the integrity of your codebase.

- **Multiple Instances:** You can create separate development environments with different configurations for the same app.






## Getting started

Version control in Appsmith is similar to the traditional Git workflow. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Connect Your App:** Connect your Appsmith app to any Git hosting provider using the SSH URL and Deploy keys.
2. **Setup Branches:** Create separate branches based on your project requirements. Each branch that you create has its own unique URL.
3. **Commit Changes:** Commit and push changes to the remote repository using the **+** plus icon available on the bottom navigation bar.
4. **Merge and Pull:** Merge and pull changes using the properties available on the bottom navigation bar.
5. **Automate:** Configure CI/CD to automate the integration process.
