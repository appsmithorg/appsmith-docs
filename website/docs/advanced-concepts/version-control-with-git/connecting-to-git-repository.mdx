# Connect Git Repository

The first step to using version control in Appsmith is to connect your remote repository with the app. Please follow the steps given below:

:::info
Version Control works with any Git hosting service that supports **SSH protocol** and **deploy keys**. HTTPS Git connections are currently not supported on Appsmith.
:::

### Generate a deploy key

1. Open the Appsmith app you want to connect to Git and click the **Connect Git** button on the left of the bottom bar.
2. Select the Git service provider of your choice and create a new Git repository if you don't already have one.
3. Paste the repository's `SSH URL` in step 2 to generate the SSH key.
4. Copy the **SSH key**.

## Add the deploy key in the Repository

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Complete Git setup

Go back to Git connection Modal in Appsmith and click **Connect**, it may take some time and when the connection is successful, the app is added to your repository by system generated commit.

:::caution
A user needs to have **Create** permission for application resources on the workspace to be able to connect or disconnect an app to Git. This permission can be shared through Workspace Administrator and Developer roles or through custom roles using granular access control. For more information, see [Default Roles](/advanced-concepts/invite-users#default-roles-for-workspace) and [Granular Access Control](/advanced-concepts/granular-access-control/roles#application-resources).
