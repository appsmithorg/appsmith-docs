# Connect To a Git Repository

The first step to using version control in Appsmith is to connect your remote repository with the app. Please follow the steps given below:

### Prerequisites

Create a new repository on your Git hosting service and copy the `SSH URL`. The repository shouldn't contain any files.

:::info
Version Control works with any Git hosting service that supports **SSH protocol** and **deploy keys**. HTTPS Git connections are currently not supported on Appsmith.
:::

### Generate a deploy key

1. Open the Appsmith app you want to connect to Git and click the **Connect Git** button on the left of the bottom bar.
2. In the Git connection Modal, paste your repository’s `SSH URL` and click the **Generate Key** button to generate an SSH key.
