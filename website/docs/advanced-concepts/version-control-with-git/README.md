# Version Control With Git

Version Control with Git allows you to version control your apps by connecting them with a Git hosting provider (Github, GitLab, Bitbucket), making it easier to track changes, create rollbacks or collaborate using git branches.

**Note:**

:::info
Version Control works with any Git hosting service that supports SSH protocol and deploy keys. HTTPS Git connections are currently not supported on Appsmith.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Version control with Git in Appsmith -

* [Connect to your Git Repository](connecting-to-git-repository.md)
* [Import from a Git Repository](connecting-to-git-repository.md#importing-from-a-repository)

:::info
In the community edition, You can connect up to **three** private repositories in a workspace. If you wish to connect more, you can upgrade to the [**business** edition](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing). However, you can connect **unlimited** public repositories.

## Git In Action

Once your app connects to the Git repository, you can further learn how version control works on Appsmith.
The flow is similar to how you work on Git -

* [Commit and Push](commit-and-push.md)
* [Work with Branches](working-with-branches.md)
* [Pull and Sync](pull-and-sync.md)
* [Merging Branches](merging-branches.md)
* [Disconnect the Git repository](disconnect-the-git-repository.md)
* [Update local file path](updating-local-file-path.md)
