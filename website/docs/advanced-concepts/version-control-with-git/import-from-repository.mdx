# Import From Repository

​If you already have an Appsmith App in a Git repository, you can import it to a new workspace or a different Appsmith account.

Follow the steps given below:

1. On the Appsmith workspace home, click on desired workspace Menu button and select **Import**.
2. Choose the **Import from a Git repository** option on the import application pop-up.
3. On the import from the Git repository modal, add your Repository’s SSH URL and click on **Generate key** and copy the key.
4. Add the Deploy key to your repository.

2. On the navigation bar, under **Security**, click **Deploy Keys**. 
3. Click **Add deploy key**. Add a title for the key and paste the generated `SSH key` in the **Key** input box.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Bitbucket" value="bitbucket">

1. Open **Personal Bitbucket settings** from the top right corner and under security go to **SSH keys**.
2. Click **Add key**, add the label and paste the generated key in the **Key** input box.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

5. Go back to the Git connection modal and click **Import**.
6. Once the import is complete, you’ll see a **Reconnect Datasources** modal where you can configure the data sources used by the imported Application. Appsmith doesn't export any configuration values used for connecting a data source. So either you have to configure it in the Reconnect Datasources modal, or you can skip this and choose to configure it later.

:::info
If the imported workspace already has a datasource with the same name but a different type, the import fails due to name conflicts. For example, a git-connected application has a MongoDB data source - "movies" and you are importing it to a workspace that has a Postgres data source also named "movies." In such a case, the import fails.

## Sync branches

To sync the local with the remote branch (fetching or pruning), click on the branch pop-up and hit the **Sync branches** button. Syncing the branches won’t merge any change you’ve made on the remote branch. You’ll have to click on the pull button to get the latest changes.
