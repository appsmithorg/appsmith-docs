# Telemetry

Telemetry in Appsmith refers to the collection of data about how users interact with the platform. This data helps the Appsmith team identify usage patterns, troubleshoot issues, and make informed decisions about new features and improvements.

## Data collected by Appsmith

Appsmith is a lightweight proxy and **does not capture** any data returned by your APIs, databases, or third-party tools. All data captured from a self-hosted instance is completely anonymised.

### Keep-alive ping

The Appsmith server sends a keep-alive ping every 6 hours to indicate that it's still running without any errors & captures anonymous usage data around which plugins are being used.

**Sample event**

```javascript
{
  "context": {
    "library": {
      "name": "analytics-java",
      "version": "2.1.1"
    }
  },
  "event": "execute_ACTION_TRIGGERED",
  "integrations": {},

}
```

### Navigation and clicks

The client captures anonymous behavioral data around navigation and clicks.

**Sample data**

```javascript
{
  "anonymousId": "0b62ab60-02ad-4f69-a181-d9c5eb2f97fa",
  "context": {
    "ip": "49.207.192.209",
    "library": {
      "name": "analytics.js",
      "version": "4.0.4"
    },
    "locale": "en-US",
    "page": {
      "path": "/applications",
      "referrer": "https://dev.appsmith.com/applications",
      "search": "",
      "title": "Editor | Appsmith",
      "url": "https://dev.appsmith.com/applications"
    },
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.111 Safari/537.36"
  },
  "event": "APPLICATIONS_PAGE_LOAD",

}
```

### Usage pulse for billing

The Appsmith client triggers a usage pulse whenever a user performs an action on their Appsmith instance. The usage pulse primarily contains information such as the timestamp, a hashed `userId` to map the user, and the app mode in which the action was performed. The data collected on the server-side and sent to the Appsmith cloud services in batches every hour. Below is an example of the payload sent from the server to Appsmith cloud services:

```javascript
{
  "usageData": [
    {
      "user": "f3273dd18d95bc19d51d3e6356e4a679e6f13824497272a270e7bb540b0abb9d", // unique hashed-id for each user
      "tenantId": "6fh76357fbe7e44f3a47a", 
      // flag to determine if usage occurred in view mode or edit mode of application. We donâ€™t charge developers when they are building their apps in edit mode
      "viewMode": false, 
      "isAnonymousUser": false, // flag to determine if pulse was triggered by logged-in user or an anonymous user
      "createdAt": 188474747 // timestamp of usage pulse
    }
  ],
  //message and hashMessage are for cloud-services to check the integrity of the data, ensuring that the pulses are sent by the real instance owning this license key
  "message": "hash-message",
  "hashedMessage": "c8ec6166d030765ff0f88ce40f4494bc6ef99f9d65dfbecd974c6359d1cac7ac",
  "instanceId": "63ef757fbe7e44f3a47a"
}

```

## Disable telemetry

You can either disable the telemetry from [**Admin Settings**](telemetry.md#admin-settings) or by making changes to the [**`docker.env`**](telemetry.md#docker.env-file) file.

### Admin Settings

- Navigate to **Admin Settings** >> **General** >> Scroll to **Share anonymous usage** **data.**

- Click Save & Restart to restart the container for the changes to take effect.

### Docker.env file

- Navigate to the **directory** where the `docker.env` file is located.
- Open the file in an editor and search for `APPSMITH_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`
- Change the value of `APPSMITH_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` from `false` to `true` and save it
- Navigate to the location where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located **`(docker host directory)`**.
- Restart the container using the command

```bash
sudo docker-compose rm -fsv appsmith && sudo docker-compose up -d
```

- Once the container restarts, Appsmith is up and running.

You can verify that the telemetry is turned off by navigating to [**Admin Settings**](telemetry.md#admin-settings) and checking the toggle for **Share anonymous usage** **data.**
