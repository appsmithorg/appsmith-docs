## Debugging with Consoles & Browser Tools

1. **Appsmith In-App Console (Editor Console)**

<dd>

* The **Appsmith Console** inside the editor is the first stop when debugging an app:
  - Open the Appsmith editor → bottom panel → **Console** tab.
* **What it shows:**
  - Logs generated by `showAlert()` or `console.log()` calls inside queries and JS objects.
  - API & DB query responses (success, failure, latency).
  - Evaluation errors for bindings (e.g., "Cannot read property of undefined").
* **How to use it effectively:**
  - Reproduce the issue and watch for red errors in real time.
  - Use the **filter** controls to narrow logs by severity.
  - Expand query responses to inspect returned JSON.
* **Best practice:** Always check the Appsmith Console first — it often surfaces the error without needing browser DevTools.

</dd>

2. **Browser Developer Tools — When to Go Deeper**

<dd>

* If the Appsmith Console doesn't provide enough detail, move to **browser DevTools**.
* **Steps to gather HAR & Console logs:**
  - Navigate to the app and stop just before reproducing the issue.
  - Open Chrome Developer Tools: Right-click → **Inspect** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Win/Linux) / **Cmd+Opt+I** (Mac).
  - **Network Tab:** Check **"Preserve log"** at the top, reproduce the issue, export the HAR file (⬇ icon).
  - **Console Tab:** Right-click → **Save as…** to export console logs.
* **Network Tab Deep Dive:**
  - Focus on **XHR / Fetch** requests and filter for **`execute`** to isolate API calls made by the app.
  - Inspect: request URL, status codes, response body, headers, timings.
  - **Note:** Request body inspection is only available in **Edit mode**, not in **View mode**.
* **Console Tab Deep Dive:**
  - Look for red errors (critical) and yellow warnings.
  - Expand logs for context and use search to filter logs.

</dd>

3. **Application Tab — Local Storage**

<dd>

* Inspect **Local Storage** for persisted state (`appsmith.store`) and **Session Storage** for transient state.
* **Identify which app data belongs to:**
  - Grab the `applicationId`: Open the app → **Network** pane from debugger tools → Refresh page → Search for **`applicationId`** → Copy ID from payload.
  - Filter Local Storage keys with that `applicationId`.
* Useful when debugging why certain stored values aren't loading or persisting correctly.

</dd>

## Accessing Server-Side Logs & Instance Health

1. **Quick Instance Checks**

<dd>

* Before diving into container logs, use Appsmith's built-in endpoints:
  - **`/info`** — Shows the **Appsmith version** the instance is running. Helps confirm if the issue could be version-specific.
  - **`/api/v1/health`** — Monitor the availability and status of a self-hosted Appsmith instance. Helps detect downtime early and ensures the system is running as expected.
  - **`/api/v1/consolidated-api/view`** — Provides insights into API response times, user session details, feature flag statuses, and system configuration.
* These endpoints are especially helpful when debugging **customer environments** before escalating to support.

</dd>

2. **Getting Container Logs**

<dd>

* Follow the documentation: [Get Container Logs](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup/instance-management/how-to-get-container-logs)
* **What to Look For in Logs:**
  - **Timestamp alignment:** correlate logs with when the issue occurred.
  - **Error-related keywords:** e.g., `Exception`, `Timeout`, `Connection refused`, Out‑of‑memory, or container restarts.
  - **Service context:** Identify which log (backend, editor, rts, etc.) is relevant to the failure.

</dd>

## Checking for Existing Issues

1. **GitHub Issues Search Strategy**

<dd>

* Before spending time reproducing or escalating an issue, check the **Appsmith GitHub Issues** page:
  - Go to: [https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/issues](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/issues)
* **Use the Search bar to look for:**
  - Error messages from your logs
  - Feature name (e.g., "PostgreSQL plugin")
  - Keywords related to the problem (e.g., "timeout", "deploy", "login")
* **Filter by:**
  - **Open** issues (current bugs)
  - **Closed** issues (to see if it was recently fixed)
  - **Label** for categorization
* **Review the discussion for:**
  - Workarounds
  - Status updates
  - Links to fixes in upcoming releases

</dd>

## Connecting with Appsmith Support

1. **Support Channels and Best Practices**

<dd>

* When users need help with Appsmith, prompt access to support is crucial.
* Follow the documentation: [Appsmith Support](https://docs.appsmith.com/product/support)
* **Information to include for effective support requests:**
  - Clear description of the issue and steps to reproduce
  - Appsmith version and deployment type
  - Browser console logs and HAR files (when applicable)
  - Server-side logs (for self-hosted instances)
  - Screenshots or screen recordings demonstrating the issue

</dd>

## Using Audit Logs for Debugging

1. **Accessing and Filtering Audit Logs**

<dd>

* Navigate to **Settings → Audit Logs**
  *(Note: While typically accessed by Admins, **users/developers can also be granted audit log access only** without needing full admin rights.)*
* **Key Filters for Debugging:**
  - **Event Type** = API Call
  - **User ID** = End user affected
  - **Time Range** = When issue happened
  - **Resource ID** = The specific API/Query ID (found in the **URL** when the query/API page is open in **Edit mode**)

</dd>

2. **Analyzing Audit Logs for Issues**

<dd>

* **Look for:**
  - Failed calls
  - High latency
  - Unauthorized attempts
* **Documentation:** [Audit Logs Guide](https://docs.appsmith.com/advanced-concepts/audit-logs)
* Use audit logs in combination with other debugging techniques for comprehensive troubleshooting.

</dd>

## Debugging Flow Recommendation

1. **Systematic Debugging Approach**

<dd>

* **Step 1: Start with Appsmith Console (in-App Editor)**
  - Quickest method with app-context logs
* **Step 2: If unresolved → Browser DevTools Console**
  - For runtime JS errors outside Appsmith logs
* **Step 3: If API/data issues → Browser Network tab**
  - For request/response details, HAR export
* **Step 4: If state issues → Application tab**
  - Inspect local storage for `appsmith.store` entries
* **Step 5: Check GitHub Issues**
  - Search for known issues before escalating
* **Step 6: Gather server logs if needed**
  - Use health endpoints and container logs
* **Step 7: Use Audit Logs for user activity**
  - When debugging user-specific or permission-related issues
