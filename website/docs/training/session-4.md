## Getting Started 

**Ignore this if you were able to attend the previous Session.**

1. Sign up on this instance: [Training Instance](https://training.app.appsmith.com/user/signup)

2. Create a workspace of your own and name it as **\<Name\>-Training-Workspace**

3. Share access to this workspace to **Training Admin** as an Administrator

4. From the workspace, click on the top-right **info icon**, then select **Chat with us**. This is Appsmithâ€™s support assistant that can help you with any issues. Send a test message to familiarize yourself with the support feature.

##  Advanced JavaScript and API Integrations

1. **Custom JS Libraries**

<dd>

* Click on the Libraries icon, second last from the bottom on the left pane
* Here, you will find pre-installed libraries like **lodash** and **moment.js**, along with an option to **Add new libraries**.
* Browse through the **Recommended Libraries** or search for other libraries via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com).
* You will also see an option to add other libraries from the site [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com)
* Search for **currency.js** and select it.
* Copy the URL from the **src** tag or use the direct link below:

<details>
  <summary>Show library url</summary>
  <div>
    ```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/currency.js@2.0.4/dist/currency.min.js```
  </div>
</details>

* Paste the copied link into the Add JS Library input field and click Install.
* Once installed, you can now use the currency.js functions anywhere in your Appsmith app.
* Example:
  - Drag and drop a Text widget.
  - Enter a large numeric value with moustache brackets `{{}}`
  - Surround the value with the currency function to display the amount in a properly formatted currency.
  ```jsx currency(value).format()``` 

</dd>

2. **API Chaining and Error handling with Javascript**

<dd>

* Use async/await to chain multiple API calls and queries in a controlled sequence.
* Implement try/catch or .then/.catch for error handling to manage failures gracefully.
* Utilize Promises to run multiple actions in parallel while maintaining control over their execution flow.

</dd>

3. **Debugger**

<dd>

* Click the Debug button at the bottom-right corner of the Editor to open the Debugger Console
* The Logs section displays:
 - Actions triggered by widgets (e.g., button clicks).
 - API requests and responses, including success/failure status.
* The Linter tab highlights widgets with issues and clicking on an error will navigate directly to the affected widget for quick fixes
* Open the Network Tab in the Developer tool of the Browser. Whenever an API/Query is triggered, the tab shows the follow details
 - API requests wrapped in executeAction (in Edit mode).
 - Sent parameters and the endpoint being called in the requests
 - In View mode, the API request is seen but additional details like endpoint and parameters are hidden for security reasons.

</dd>

## Embedding Appsmith Applications and Facilitating Communication

1. **Embedding applications**

<dd>

* Click on the **Share** button in the top-right corner to open the **Share Modal**.
* Navigate to the **Embed** tab to view the **Embed URL** and a **Preview embedded app** option.
* Configure embed settings based on access requirements:
  - **Public Embed:** Making the App public allows anyone to access the embedded app.
  - **Private Embed:** Requires authentication to access the embedded content.
* For **private embeds**, you can also pass an **SSO method** in the embed URL to authenticate users seamlessly.

</dd>

2. **Communicating between Appsmith Embeds and Parent page**

<dd>

* Appsmith provides methods to enable two-way communication between the **embedded app** and the **parent page**
* Use `postWindowMessage()` to send data or events from Appsmith to the parent page.
  ```postWindowMessage("Appsmith Ready", { status: "initialized" });```
* Use `windowMessageListener()` in Appsmith to listen for messages from the parent page and trigger actions accordingly.
  ```jsx
  windowMessageListener((message) => {
    if (message.data === "refresh") {
      getData.run(); // Trigger an action inside Appsmith
    }
  });
  ```
</dd>
