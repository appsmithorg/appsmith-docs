3. Share access to this workspace to **Training Admin** as an Administrator

##  Advanced JavaScript and API Integrations

1. **Custom JS Libraries**

<dd>

* Click on the Libraries icon, second last from the bottom on the left pane
* Here, you will find pre-installed libraries like **lodash** and **moment.js**, along with an option to **Add new libraries**.
* Browse through the **Recommended Libraries** or search for other libraries via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com).
* You will also see an option to add other libraries from the site [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com)
* Search for **currency.js** and select it.
* Copy the URL from the **src** tag or use the direct link below:

<details>
  <summary>Show library url</summary>
  <div>
    ```jsx
    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/currency.js@2.0.4/dist/currency.min.js
    ```
  </div>
</details>

* Paste the copied link into the Add JS Library input field and click Install.
* Once installed, you can now use the currency.js functions anywhere in your Appsmith app.
* Example:
  - Drag and drop a Text widget.
  - Enter a large numeric value with moustache brackets `{{}}`
  - Surround the value with the currency function to display the amount in a properly formatted currency.
  ```jsx currency(value).format()``` 

</dd>

2. **API Chaining and Error handling with Javascript**

<dd>

* Use async/await to chain multiple API calls and queries in a controlled sequence.
* Implement try/catch or .then/.catch for error handling to manage failures gracefully.
* Utilize Promises to run multiple actions in parallel while maintaining control over their execution flow.

</dd>

3. **Debugger**

<dd>

* Click the Debug button at the bottom-right corner of the Editor to open the Debugger Console
* The Logs section displays:
 - Actions triggered by widgets (e.g., button clicks).
 - API requests and responses, including success/failure status.
* The Linter tab highlights widgets with issues and clicking on an error will navigate directly to the affected widget for quick fixes
* Open the Network Tab in the Developer tool of the Browser. Whenever an API/Query is triggered, the tab shows the follow details
 - API requests wrapped in executeAction (in Edit mode).
 - Sent parameters and the endpoint being called in the requests
 - In View mode, the API request is seen but additional details like endpoint and parameters are hidden for security reasons.
