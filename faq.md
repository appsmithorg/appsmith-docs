# FAQs

## What kind of apps can be built on Appsmith?

You can use Appsmith to build custom forms, dashboards & workflows. Tools like customer support dashboards, offer management consoles & product cataloging systems are all prime use cases for Appsmith. You can also use it as a clean UI layer over manually triggered scripts, confusing deployment pipelines & basic database CRUD operations. There's very little preventing you from using Appsmith to bring any idea to life but we've optimized the product to make building internal tools a hassle free experience.

## How is Appsmith different from other app builders?

Appsmith is the first open-source visual framework for building internal tools. Appsmith makes building internal tool building easy, by giving you building blocks (widgets, APIs, Queries) which you can configure and connect together while the framework does most of the heavy lifting.

## Can I write code in Appsmith?

Yes, absolutely. You can write JS code anywhere inside the product within `{{ }}`. We know how complex and intricate business logic can be and trying to build it without code can get excruciating.  Appsmith bridges mundane API and UI configurations with powerful code expressions to let you build the apps the way you see them fit.

## Is my data safe?

Appsmith safely encrypts all your database credentials and stores them securely. Appsmith also does not store any data returned from your data sources and acts only as a proxy layer to orchestrate the API / Query calls. Appsmith is an open-source framework and can be fully audited and deployed on-premise to ensure none of your data leaves your VPC.

## What if I get stuck while building an app on Appsmith?

We sincerely hope this never happens to anyone but we acknowledge that there can be road blocks. At this juncture, we're working on a way for you to be able to write custom react components and plugins to unblock you from any platform limitations. In the meantime, if the absence of any feature is limiting you, you can write to [support@appsmith.com](mailto:%20support@appsmith.com) or reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp) 

## What can't I do on Appsmith?

Appsmith isn't built for complicated UI interactions that are common to e-commerce or other consumer-facing websites. It works great for tools internal to your team or organization but you wouldn't get very far trying to build an attractive consumer website. For those use cases, we'd recommend you try [Wix](www.wix.com), [Squarespace](www.squarespace.com), or [Webflow](www.webflow.com). You can also perform some simple data visualization & charting on Appsmith but for more in-depth business intelligence & analytics, we'd recommend [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Looker](https://looker.com/), or [Redash](https://redash.io/).
